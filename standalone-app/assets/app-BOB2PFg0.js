  mechanic for providing a registry is [declaration merging][handbook].

  [handbook]: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html

  For example, Ember's `@ember/service` module includes this set of definitions:

  ```ts
  export default class Service extends EmberObject {}

  // For concrete singleton classes to be merged into.
  interface Registry extends Record<string, Service> {}

  declare module '@ember/owner' {
    service: Registry;
  }
  ```

  Declarations of services can then include the registry:

  ```ts
  import Service from '@ember/service';

  export default class Session extends Service {
    login(username: string, password: string) {
      // ...
    }
  }

  declare module '@ember/service' {
    interface Registry {
      session: Session;
    }
  }
  ```

  Then users of the `Owner` API will be able to do things like this with strong
  type safety guarantees:

  ```ts
  getOwner(this)?.lookup('service:session').login("hello", "1234abcd");
  ```

/**
  Ember’s dependency injection system is built on the idea of an "owner": an

  This module does not provide any concrete instances of owners. Instead, it
  defines the core type, `Owner`, which specifies the public API contract for an
  owner. The primary concrete implementations of `Owner` are `EngineInstance`,
  from `@ember/engine/instance`, and its `ApplicationInstance` subclass, from
  `@ember/application/instance`.

  Along with `Owner` itself, this module provides a number of supporting types
  related to Ember's DI system:

  - `Factory`, Ember's primary interface for something which can create class
    instances registered with the DI system.

  - `FactoryManager`, an interface for inspecting a `Factory`'s class.

  - `Resolver`, an interface defining the contract for the object responsible
    for mapping string names to the corresponding classes. For example, when you
    write `@service('session')`, a resolver is responsible to map that back to
    the `Session` service class in your codebase. Normally, this is handled for
    you automatically with `ember-resolver`, which is the main implementor of
    this interface.

  For more details on each, see their per-item docs.

     Ember itself leverages [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) to aid
    projects in keeping up with changes to the framework. Before any
    functionality or API is removed, it first flows linearly through a
    deprecation staging process. The staging process currently contains two
    stages: available and enabled.
     Deprecations are initially released into the 'available' stage.
    Deprecations will stay in this stage until the replacement API has been
    marked as a recommended practice via the RFC process and the addon
    ecosystem has generally adopted the change.
     Once a deprecation meets the above criteria, it will move into the
    'enabled' stage where it will remain until the functionality or API is

/**
  Strongly hint runtimes to intern the provided string.

  When do I need to use this function?

  For the most part, never. Pre-mature optimization is bad, and often the
  runtime does exactly what you need it to, and more often the trade-off isn't
  worth it.

  Why?

  Runtimes store strings in at least 2 different representations:
  Ropes and Symbols (interned strings). The Rope provides a memory efficient
  data-structure for strings created from concatenation or some other string
  manipulation like splitting.

  Unfortunately checking equality of different ropes can be quite costly as
  runtimes must resort to clever string comparison algorithms. These
  algorithms typically cost in proportion to the length of the string.
  Luckily, this is where the Symbols (interned strings) shine. As Symbols are
  unique by their string content, equality checks can be done by pointer
  comparison.

  How do I know if my string is a rope or symbol?

  Typically (warning general sweeping statement, but truthy in runtimes at
  present) static strings created as part of the JS source are interned.
  Strings often used for comparisons can be interned at runtime if some
  criteria are met.  One of these criteria can be the size of the entire rope.
  For example, in chrome 38 a rope longer then 12 characters will not
  intern, nor will segments of that rope.

  Some numbers: http://jsperf.com/eval-vs-keys/8

/**
  Strongly hint runtimes to intern the provided string.

  When do I need to use this function?

  For the most part, never. Pre-mature optimization is bad, and often the
  runtime does exactly what you need it to, and more often the trade-off isn't
  worth it.

  Why?

  Runtimes store strings in at least 2 different representations:
  Ropes and Symbols (interned strings). The Rope provides a memory efficient
  data-structure for strings created from concatenation or some other string
  manipulation like splitting.

  Unfortunately checking equality of different ropes can be quite costly as
  runtimes must resort to clever string comparison algorithms. These
  algorithms typically cost in proportion to the length of the string.
  Luckily, this is where the Symbols (interned strings) shine. As Symbols are
  unique by their string content, equality checks can be done by pointer
  comparison.

  How do I know if my string is a rope or symbol?

  Typically (warning general sweeping statement, but truthy in runtimes at
  present) static strings created as part of the JS source are interned.
  Strings often used for comparisons can be interned at runtime if some
  criteria are met.  One of these criteria can be the size of the entire rope.
  For example, in chrome 38 a rope longer then 12 characters will not
  intern, nor will segments of that rope.

  Some numbers: http://jsperf.com/eval-vs-keys/8

/**
  `@computed` is a decorator that turns a JavaScript getter and setter into a
  computed property, which is a _cached, trackable value_. By default the getter
  will only be called once and the result will be cached. You can specify
  various properties that your computed property depends on. This will force the
  cached result to be cleared if the dependencies are modified, and lazily recomputed the next time something asks for it.

  In the following example we decorate a getter - `fullName` -  by calling
  `computed` with the property dependencies (`firstName` and `lastName`) as
  arguments. The `fullName` getter will be called once (regardless of how many
  times it is accessed) as long as its dependencies do not change. Once
  `firstName` or `lastName` are updated any future calls to `fullName` will
  incorporate the new values, and any watchers of the value such as templates
  will be updated:

  ```javascript
  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';

  class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);
      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);
    }

    @computed('firstName', 'lastName')
    get fullName() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }
  });

  let tom = new Person('Tom', 'Dale');

  tom.fullName; // 'Tom Dale'
  ```

  You can also provide a setter, which will be used when updating the computed
  property. Ember's `set` function must be used to update the property
  since it will also notify observers of the property:

  ```javascript
  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';

  class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);
      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);
    }

    @computed('firstName', 'lastName')
    get fullName() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }

    set fullName(value) {
      let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');

      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);
      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);
    }
  });

  let person = new Person();

  set(person, 'fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');
  person.firstName; // 'Peter'
  person.lastName;  // 'Wagenet'
  ```

  You can also pass a getter function or object with `get` and `set` functions
  as the last argument to the computed decorator. This allows you to define
  computed property _macros_:

  ```js
  import { computed } from '@ember/object';

  function join(...keys) {
    return computed(...keys, function() {
      return keys.map(key => this[key]).join(' ');
    });
  }

  class Person {
    @join('firstName', 'lastName')
    fullName;
  }
  ```

  Note that when defined this way, getters and setters receive the _key_ of the
  property they are decorating as the first argument. Setters receive the value
  they are setting to as the second argument instead. Additionally, setters must
  _return_ the value that should be cached:

  ```javascript
  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';

  function fullNameMacro(firstNameKey, lastNameKey) {
    return computed(firstNameKey, lastNameKey, {
      get() {
        return `${this[firstNameKey]} ${this[lastNameKey]}`;
      }

      set(key, value) {
        let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');

        set(this, firstNameKey, firstName);
        set(this, lastNameKey, lastName);

        return value;
      }
    });
  }

  class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);
      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);
    }

    @fullNameMacro('firstName', 'lastName') fullName;
  });

  let person = new Person();

  set(person, 'fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');
  person.firstName; // 'Peter'
  person.lastName;  // 'Wagenet'
  ```

  Computed properties can also be used in classic classes. To do this, we
  provide the getter and setter as the last argument like we would for a macro,
  and we assign it to a property on the class definition. This is an _anonymous_
  computed macro:

  ```javascript
  import EmberObject, { computed, set } from '@ember/object';

  let Person = EmberObject.extend({
    // these will be supplied by `create`
    firstName: null,
    lastName: null,

    fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', {
      get() {
        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
      }

      set(key, value) {
        let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');

        set(this, 'firstName', firstName);
        set(this, 'lastName', lastName);

        return value;
      }
    })
  });

  let tom = Person.create({
    firstName: 'Tom',
    lastName: 'Dale'
  });

  tom.get('fullName') // 'Tom Dale'
  ```

  You can overwrite computed property without setters with a normal property (no
  longer computed) that won't change if dependencies change. You can also mark
  computed property as `.readOnly()` and block all attempts to set it.

  ```javascript
  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';

  class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);
      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);
    }

    @computed('firstName', 'lastName').readOnly()
    get fullName() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }
  });

  let person = new Person();
  person.set('fullName', 'Peter Wagenet'); // Uncaught Error: Cannot set read-only property "fullName" on object: <(...):emberXXX>
  ```

  });

  let client = Person.create();

  client.get('fullName'); // 'Betty Jones'

  client.set('lastName', 'Fuller');
  client.get('fullName'); // 'Betty Fuller'
  ```

  You can also provide a setter, either directly on the class using native class
  syntax, or by passing a hash with `get` and `set` functions.

  Example:

  ```js
  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';

  class Person {
    constructor() {
      this.firstName = 'Betty';
      this.lastName = 'Jones';
    },

    @computed('firstName', 'lastName')
    get fullName() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }

    set fullName(value) {
      let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(/\s+/);

      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);
      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);

      return value;
    }
  }

  let client = new Person();

  client.fullName; // 'Betty Jones'

  set(client, 'lastName', 'Fuller');
  client.fullName; // 'Betty Fuller'
  ```

  Classic Class Example:

  ```js
  import EmberObject, { computed } from '@ember/object';

  let Person = EmberObject.extend({
    init() {
      this._super(...arguments);

      this.firstName = 'Betty';
      this.lastName = 'Jones';
    },

    fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', {
      get(key) {
        return `${this.get('firstName')} ${this.get('lastName')}`;
      },
      set(key, value) {
        let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(/\s+/);
        this.setProperties({ firstName, lastName });
        return value;
      }
    })
  });

  let client = Person.create();
  client.get('firstName'); // 'Betty'

  client.set('fullName', 'Carroll Fuller');
  client.get('firstName'); // 'Carroll'
  ```

  When passed as an argument, the `set` function should accept two parameters,
  `key` and `value`. The value returned from `set` will be the new value of the
  property.

/**
  Allows you to specify which context to call the specified function in while
  adding the execution of that function to the Ember run loop. This ability
  makes this method a great way to asynchronously integrate third-party libraries
  into your Ember application.

  `bind` takes two main arguments, the desired context and the function to
  invoke in that context. Any additional arguments will be supplied as arguments
  to the function that is passed in.

  Let's use the creation of a TinyMCE component as an example. Currently,
  TinyMCE provides a setup configuration option we can use to do some processing
  after the TinyMCE instance is initialized but before it is actually rendered.
  We can use that setup option to do some additional setup for our component.
  The component itself could look something like the following:

  ```app/components/rich-text-editor.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';
  import { on } from '@ember/object/evented';
  import { bind } from '@ember/runloop';

  export default Component.extend({
    initializeTinyMCE: on('didInsertElement', function() {
      tinymce.init({
        selector: '#' + this.$().prop('id'),
        setup: bind(this, this.setupEditor)
      });
    }),

    didInsertElement() {
      tinymce.init({
        selector: '#' + this.$().prop('id'),
        setup: bind(this, this.setupEditor)
      });
    }

    setupEditor(editor) {
      this.set('editor', editor);

      editor.on('change', function() {
        console.log('content changed!');
      });
    }
  });
  ```

  In this example, we use `bind` to bind the setupEditor method to the
  context of the RichTextEditor component and to have the invocation of that
  method be safely handled and executed by the Ember run loop.

  @method bind
  @static
  @for @ember/runloop
  @param {Object} [target] target of method to call
  @param {Function|String} method Method to invoke.

/**
  Schedules a function to run one time in a given queue of the current RunLoop.
  Calling this method with the same queue/target/method combination will have
  no effect (past the initial call).

  Note that although you can pass optional arguments these will not be
  considered when looking for duplicates. New arguments will replace previous
  calls.

  ```javascript
  import { run, scheduleOnce } from '@ember/runloop';

  function sayHi() {
    console.log('hi');
  }

  run(function() {
    scheduleOnce('afterRender', myContext, sayHi);
    scheduleOnce('afterRender', myContext, sayHi);
    // sayHi will only be executed once, in the afterRender queue of the RunLoop
  });
  ```

  Also note that for `scheduleOnce` to prevent additional calls, you need to
  pass the same function instance. The following case works as expected:

  ```javascript
  function log() {
    console.log('Logging only once');
  }

  function scheduleIt() {
    scheduleOnce('actions', myContext, log);
  }

  scheduleIt();
  scheduleIt();
  ```

  But this other case will schedule the function multiple times:

  ```javascript
  import { scheduleOnce } from '@ember/runloop';

  function scheduleIt() {
    scheduleOnce('actions', myContext, function() {
      console.log('Closure');
    });
  }

  scheduleIt();
  scheduleIt();

  // "Closure" will print twice, even though we're using `scheduleOnce`,
  // because the function we pass to it won't match the
  // previously scheduled operation.
  ```

function scheduleOnce(...args) {
  // @ts-expect-error TS doesn't like the rest args here
  return _backburner.scheduleOnce(...args);
}

/**
  Schedules an item to run from within a separate run loop, after
  control has been returned to the system. This is equivalent to calling
  `later` with a wait time of 1ms.

  ```javascript
  import { next } from '@ember/runloop';

  next(myContext, function() {
    // code to be executed in the next run loop,
    // which will be scheduled after the current one
  });
  ```

  Multiple operations scheduled with `next` will coalesce
  into the same later run loop, along with any other operations
  scheduled by `later` that expire right around the same
  time that `next` operations will fire.

  Note that there are often alternatives to using `next`.
  For instance, if you'd like to schedule an operation to happen
  after all DOM element operations have completed within the current
  run loop, you can make use of the `afterRender` run loop queue (added
  by the `ember-views` package, along with the preceding `render` queue
  where all the DOM element operations happen).

  Example:

  ```app/components/my-component.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';
  import { scheduleOnce } from '@ember/runloop';

  export default class MyComponent extends Component {
    didInsertElement() {
      super.didInsertElement();
      scheduleOnce('afterRender', this, 'processChildElements');
    },

    processChildElements() {
      // ... do something with component's child component
      // elements after they've finished rendering, which
      // can't be done within this component's
      // `didInsertElement` hook because that gets run
      // before the child elements have been added to the DOM.
    }
  }
  ```

  One benefit of the above approach compared to using `next` is
  that you will be able to perform DOM/CSS operations before unprocessed
  elements are rendered to the screen, which may prevent flickering or
  other artifacts caused by delaying processing until after rendering.

  The other major benefit to the above approach is that `next`
  introduces an element of non-determinism, which can make things much
  harder to test, due to its reliance on `setTimeout`; it's much harder
  to guarantee the order of scheduled operations when they are scheduled
  outside of the current run loop, i.e. with `next`.

  This method should be used when an event may be called multiple times
  but the action should only be called once when the event is done firing.
  A common example is for scroll events where you only want updates to
  happen once scrolling has ceased.

  other calls for this function until the wait time has elapsed. If

/**
  The `Mixin` class allows you to create mixins, whose properties can be
  added to other classes. For instance,

  ```javascript
  import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';

  const EditableMixin = Mixin.create({
    edit() {
      console.log('starting to edit');
      this.set('isEditing', true);
    },
    isEditing: false
  });
  ```

  ```javascript
  import EmberObject from '@ember/object';
  import EditableMixin from '../mixins/editable';

  // Mix mixins into classes by passing them as the first arguments to
  // `.extend.`
  class Comment extends EmberObject.extend(EditableMixin) {
    post = null
  }

  let comment = Comment.create({
    post: somePost
  });

  comment.edit(); // outputs 'starting to edit'
  ```

  Note that Mixins are created with `Mixin.create`, not
  `Mixin.extend`.

  Note that mixins extend a constructor's prototype so arrays and object literals
  defined as properties will be shared amongst objects that implement the mixin.
  If you want to define a property in a mixin that is not shared, you can define
  it either as a computed property or have it be created on initialization of the object.

  ```javascript
  // filters array will be shared amongst any object implementing mixin
  import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';
  import { A } from '@ember/array';

  const FilterableMixin = Mixin.create({
    filters: A()
  });
  ```

  ```javascript
  import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';
  import { A } from '@ember/array';
  import { computed } from '@ember/object';

  // filters will be a separate array for every object implementing the mixin
  const FilterableMixin = Mixin.create({
    filters: computed(function() {
      return A();
    })
  });
  ```

  ```javascript
  import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';
  import { A } from '@ember/array';

  // filters will be created as a separate array during the object's initialization
  const Filterable = Mixin.create({
    filters: null,

    init() {
      this._super(...arguments);
      this.set("filters", A());
    }

    The collection of functions, keyed by name, available on this

     These functions will be invoked when a matching `{{action}}` is triggered
    from within a template and the application's current route is this route.
     Actions can also be invoked from other parts of your application
    via `ActionHandler#send`.
     The `actions` hash will inherit action handlers from
    the `actions` hash defined on extended parent classes
    or mixins rather than just replace the entire hash, e.g.:
     ```app/mixins/can-display-banner.js
    import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';
     export default Mixin.create({
      actions: {
        displayBanner(msg) {
          // ...
        }
      }
    });
    ```
     ```app/routes/welcome.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
    import CanDisplayBanner from '../mixins/can-display-banner';
     export default Route.extend(CanDisplayBanner, {
      actions: {
        playMusic() {
          // ...
        }
      }
    });
     // `WelcomeRoute`, when active, will be able to respond
    // to both actions, since the actions hash is merged rather
    // then replaced when extending mixins / parent classes.
    this.send('displayBanner');
    this.send('playMusic');
    ```
     Within a Controller, Route or Component's action handler,
    the value of the `this` context is the Controller, Route or
    Component object:
     ```app/routes/song.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
     export default Route.extend({
      actions: {
        myAction() {
          this.controllerFor("song");
          this.transitionTo("other.route");
          ...
        }
      }
    });
    ```
     It is also possible to call `this._super(...arguments)` from within an
    action handler if it overrides a handler defined on a parent
    class or mixin:
     Take for example the following routes:
     ```app/mixins/debug-route.js
    import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';
     export default Mixin.create({
      actions: {
        debugRouteInformation() {
          console.debug("It's a-me, console.debug!");
        }
      }
    });
    ```
     ```app/routes/annoying-debug.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
    import DebugRoute from '../mixins/debug-route';
     export default Route.extend(DebugRoute, {
      actions: {
        debugRouteInformation() {
          // also call the debugRouteInformation of mixed in DebugRoute
          this._super(...arguments);
           // show additional annoyance
          window.alert(...);
        }
      }
    });
    ```
     ## Bubbling
     By default, an action will stop bubbling once a handler defined
    on the `actions` hash handles it. To continue bubbling the action,
    you must return `true` from the handler:
     ```app/router.js
    Router.map(function() {
      this.route("album", function() {
        this.route("song");
      });
    });
    ```
     ```app/routes/album.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
     export default Route.extend({
      actions: {
        startPlaying: function() {
        }
      }
    });
    ```
     ```app/routes/album-song.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
     export default Route.extend({
      actions: {
        startPlaying() {
          // ...
           if (actionShouldAlsoBeTriggeredOnParentRoute) {
            return true;
          }

  Send an `action` with an `actionContext` to a `target`. The action, actionContext

/**
  `Promise.all` accepts an array of promises, and returns a new promise which
  is fulfilled with an array of fulfillment values for the passed promises, or
  rejected with the reason of the first passed promise to be rejected. It casts all
  elements of the passed iterable to promises as it runs this algorithm.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  import Promise, { resolve } from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = resolve(1);
  let promise2 = resolve(2);
  let promise3 = resolve(3);
  let promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];

  Promise.all(promises).then(function(array){
    // The array here would be [ 1, 2, 3 ];
  });
  ```

  If any of the `promises` given to `RSVP.all` are rejected, the first promise
  that is rejected will be given as an argument to the returned promises's
  rejection handler. For example:

  Example:

  ```javascript
  import Promise, { resolve, reject } from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = resolve(1);
  let promise2 = reject(new Error("2"));
  let promise3 = reject(new Error("3"));
  let promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];

  Promise.all(promises).then(function(array){
    // Code here never runs because there are rejected promises!
  }, function(error) {
    // error.message === "2"
  });
  ```

  @method all
  @for Promise
  @param {Array} entries array of promises
  @param {String} [label] optional string for labeling the promise.
  Useful for tooling.
  @return {Promise} promise that is fulfilled when all `promises` have been
  fulfilled, or rejected if any of them become rejected.
  @static
*/

/**
  `Promise.race` returns a new promise which is settled in the same way as the
  first passed promise to settle.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  import Promise from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function(){
      resolve('promise 1');
    }, 200);
  });

  });

  Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(result){
    // result === 'promise 2' because it was resolved before promise1
    // was resolved.
  });
  ```

  `Promise.race` is deterministic in that only the state of the first
  settled promise matters. For example, even if other promises given to the
  `promises` array argument are resolved, but the first settled promise has
  become rejected before the other promises became fulfilled, the returned
  promise will become rejected:

  ```javascript
  import Promise from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function(){
      resolve('promise 1');
    }, 200);
  });

  let promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    setTimeout(function(){
      reject(new Error('promise 2'));
    }, 100);
  });

  Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(result){
    // Code here never runs
  }, function(reason){
    // reason.message === 'promise 2' because promise 2 became rejected before
    // promise 1 became fulfilled
  });
  ```

  An example real-world use case is implementing timeouts:

  ```javascript
  import Promise from 'rsvp';

  Promise.race([ajax('foo.json'), timeout(5000)])
  ```

/**
  Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The
  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which
  registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason
  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.

  Terminology
  -----------

  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.
  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.
  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).
  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.
  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.
  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.

  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.

  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled
  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the
  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.

  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a
  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's
  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will
  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will
  itself fulfill.


  Basic Usage:
  ------------

  ```js
  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // on success
    resolve(value);

    // on failure
    reject(reason);
  });

  promise.then(function(value) {
    // on fulfillment
  }, function(reason) {
    // on rejection
  });
  ```

  Advanced Usage:
  ---------------

  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as
  `XMLHttpRequest`s.

  ```js
  function getJSON(url) {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){

/**
  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,
  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the
  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.

  ```js
  findUser().then(function(user){
    // user is available
  }, function(reason){
    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why
  });
  ```

  Chaining
  --------

  The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'
  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment
  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.

  ```js
  findUser().then(function (user) {
    return user.name;
  }, function (reason) {
    return 'default name';
  }).then(function (userName) {
    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it
    // will be `'default name'`
  });

  findUser().then(function (user) {
    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');
  }, function (reason) {
    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we\'re unhappy');
  }).then(function (value) {
    // never reached
  }, function (reason) {
    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.
    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we\'re unhappy'.
  });
  ```
  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.

  ```js
  findUser().then(function (user) {
    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');
  }).then(function (value) {
    // never reached
  }).then(function (value) {
    // never reached
  }, function (reason) {
    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here
  });
  ```

  Assimilation
  ------------

  Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be
  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the
  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending
  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.

  ```js
  findUser().then(function (user) {
    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);
  }).then(function (comments) {
    // The user's comments are now available
  });
  ```

  If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.

  ```js
  findUser().then(function (user) {
    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);
  }).then(function (comments) {
    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here
  }, function (reason) {
    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here
  });
  ```

  Simple Example
  --------------

  Synchronous Example

  ```javascript
  let result;

  try {
    result = findResult();
    // success
  } catch(reason) {
    // failure
  }
  ```

  Errback Example

  ```js
  findResult(function(result, err){
    if (err) {
      // failure
    } else {
      // success
    }
  });
  ```

  Promise Example;

  ```javascript
  findResult().then(function(result){
    // success
  }, function(reason){
    // failure
  });
  ```

  Advanced Example
  --------------

  Synchronous Example

  ```javascript
  let author, books;

  try {
    author = findAuthor();
    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);
    // success
  } catch(reason) {
    // failure
  }
  ```

  Errback Example

  ```js

  function foundBooks(books) {

  }

  function failure(reason) {

  }

  findAuthor(function(author, err){
    if (err) {
      failure(err);
      // failure
    } else {
      try {
        findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {
          if (err) {
            failure(err);
          } else {

/**
  `denodeify` takes a 'node-style' function and returns a function that
  will return an `Promise`. You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the
  browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,
  `denodeify` transforms the following:

  ```javascript
  let fs = require('fs');

  fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){
    if (err) return handleError(err);
    handleData(data);
  });
  ```

  into:

  ```javascript
  let fs = require('fs');
  let readFile = denodeify(fs.readFile);

  readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);
  ```

  If the node function has multiple success parameters, then `denodeify`
  just returns the first one:

  ```javascript
  let request = denodeify(require('request'));

  request('http://example.com').then(function(res) {
    // ...
  });
  ```

  However, if you need all success parameters, setting `denodeify`'s
  second parameter to `true` causes it to return all success parameters
  as an array:

  ```javascript
  let request = denodeify(require('request'), true);

  request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {
    // result[0] -> res
    // result[1] -> body
  });
  ```

  Or if you pass it an array with names it returns the parameters as a hash:

  ```javascript
  let request = denodeify(require('request'), ['res', 'body']);

  request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {
    // result.res
    // result.body
  });
  ```

  Sometimes you need to retain the `this`:

  ```javascript
  let app = require('express')();
  let render = denodeify(app.render.bind(app));
  ```

  The denodified function inherits from the original function. It works in all
  environments, except IE 10 and below. Consequently all properties of the original
  function are available to you. However, any properties you change on the
  denodeified function won't be changed on the original function. Example:

  ```javascript
  let request = denodeify(require('request')),
      cookieJar = request.jar(); // <- Inheritance is used here

  request('http://example.com', {jar: cookieJar}).then(function(res) {
    // cookieJar.cookies holds now the cookies returned by example.com
  });
  ```

  Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead
  of using callbacks. For example, instead of:

  ```javascript
  let fs = require('fs');

  fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){
    if (err) { ... } // Handle error
    fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){
      if (err) { ... } // Handle error
      console.log('done')
    });
  });
  ```

  you can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:

  ```javascript
  let fs = require('fs');
  let readFile = denodeify(fs.readFile);
  let writeFile = denodeify(fs.writeFile);

  readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){
    return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);
  }).then(function(){
    console.log('done')
  }).catch(function(error){
    // Handle error
  });
  ```

  is fulfilled with a hash that has the same key names as the `promises` object

  simply be copied over to the fulfilled object.

  Example:

  ```javascript

  The returned promise is fulfilled with a hash that has the same key names as

  An important note: `hashSettled` is intended for plain JavaScript objects that
  are just a set of keys and values. `hashSettled` will NOT preserve prototype
  chains.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  import Promise, { hashSettled, resolve } from 'rsvp';

  function MyConstructor(){
    this.example = resolve('Example');
  }

  MyConstructor.prototype = {
    protoProperty: Promise.resolve('Proto Property')
  };

  let myObject = new MyConstructor();

  hashSettled(myObject).then(function(hash){
    // protoProperty will not be present, instead you will just have an
    // object that looks like:
    // {
    //   example: { state: 'fulfilled', value: 'Example' }
    // }
    //
    // hash.hasOwnProperty('protoProperty'); // false
    // 'undefined' === typeof hash.protoProperty
  });
  ```

/**
  `rethrow` will rethrow an error on the next turn of the JavaScript event
  loop in order to aid debugging.

  Promises A+ specifies that any exceptions that occur with a promise must be
  caught by the promises implementation and bubbled to the last handler. For
  this reason, it is recommended that you always specify a second rejection
  handler function to `then`. However, `rethrow` will throw the exception
  outside of the promise, so it bubbles up to your console if in the browser,
  or domain/cause uncaught exception in Node. `rethrow` will also throw the
  error again so the error can be handled by the promise per the spec.

  ```javascript
  import { rethrow } from 'rsvp';

  function throws(){
    throw new Error('Whoops!');
  }

  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
    throws();
  });

  promise.catch(rethrow).then(function(){
    // Code here doesn't run because the promise became rejected due to an
    // error!
  }, function (err){
    // handle the error here
  });
  ```

  The 'Whoops' error will be thrown on the next turn of the event loop
  and you can watch for it in your console. You can also handle it using a
  rejection handler given to `.then` or `.catch` on the returned promise.

  @method rethrow
  @public
  @static
  @for rsvp
  @param {Error} reason reason the promise became rejected.

/**
  `defer` returns an object similar to jQuery's `$.Deferred`.
  `defer` should be used when porting over code reliant on `$.Deferred`'s
  interface. New code should use the `Promise` constructor instead.

  The object returned from `defer` is a plain object with three properties:

  * promise - an `Promise`.
  * reject - a function that causes the `promise` property on this object to
    become rejected
  * resolve - a function that causes the `promise` property on this object to
    become fulfilled.

  Example:

   ```javascript
   let deferred = defer();

   deferred.resolve("Success!");

   deferred.promise.then(function(value){
     // value here is "Success!"
   });
   ```

/**
 `map` is similar to JavaScript's native `map` method. `mapFn` is eagerly called
  meaning that as soon as any promise resolves its value will be passed to `mapFn`.
  `map` returns a promise that will become fulfilled with the result of running
  `mapFn` on the values the promises become fulfilled with.

  For example:

  ```javascript
  import { map, resolve } from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = resolve(1);
  let promise2 = resolve(2);
  let promise3 = resolve(3);
  let promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];

  let mapFn = function(item){
    return item + 1;
  };

  map(promises, mapFn).then(function(result){
    // result is [ 2, 3, 4 ]
  });
  ```

  If any of the `promises` given to `map` are rejected, the first promise
  that is rejected will be given as an argument to the returned promise's
  rejection handler. For example:

  ```javascript
  import { map, reject, resolve } from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = resolve(1);
  let promise2 = reject(new Error('2'));
  let promise3 = reject(new Error('3'));
  let promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];

  let mapFn = function(item){
    return item + 1;
  };

  map(promises, mapFn).then(function(array){
    // Code here never runs because there are rejected promises!
  }, function(reason) {
    // reason.message === '2'
  });
  ```

  `map` will also wait if a promise is returned from `mapFn`. For example,
  say you want to get all comments from a set of blog posts, but you need
  the blog posts first because they contain a url to those comments.

  ```javscript
  import { map } from 'rsvp';

  let mapFn = function(blogPost){
    // getComments does some ajax and returns an Promise that is fulfilled
    // with some comments data
    return getComments(blogPost.comments_url);
  };

  // getBlogPosts does some ajax and returns an Promise that is fulfilled
  // with some blog post data
  map(getBlogPosts(), mapFn).then(function(comments){
    // comments is the result of asking the server for the comments
    // of all blog posts returned from getBlogPosts()
  });
  ```

/**
 `filter` is similar to JavaScript's native `filter` method.
 `filterFn` is eagerly called meaning that as soon as any promise
  resolves its value will be passed to `filterFn`. `filter` returns
  a promise that will become fulfilled with the result of running
  `filterFn` on the values the promises become fulfilled with.

  For example:

  ```javascript
  import { filter, resolve } from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = resolve(1);
  let promise2 = resolve(2);
  let promise3 = resolve(3);

  let promises = [promise1, promise2, promise3];

  let filterFn = function(item){
    return item > 1;
  };

  filter(promises, filterFn).then(function(result){
    // result is [ 2, 3 ]
  });
  ```

  If any of the `promises` given to `filter` are rejected, the first promise
  that is rejected will be given as an argument to the returned promise's
  rejection handler. For example:

  ```javascript
  import { filter, reject, resolve } from 'rsvp';

  let promise1 = resolve(1);
  let promise2 = reject(new Error('2'));
  let promise3 = reject(new Error('3'));
  let promises = [ promise1, promise2, promise3 ];

  let filterFn = function(item){
    return item > 1;
  };

  filter(promises, filterFn).then(function(array){
    // Code here never runs because there are rejected promises!
  }, function(reason) {
    // reason.message === '2'
  });
  ```

  `filter` will also wait for any promises returned from `filterFn`.
  For instance, you may want to fetch a list of users then return a subset
  of those users based on some asynchronous operation:

  ```javascript
  import { filter, resolve } from 'rsvp';

  let alice = { name: 'alice' };
  let bob   = { name: 'bob' };
  let users = [ alice, bob ];

  let promises = users.map(function(user){
    return resolve(user);
  });

  let filterFn = function(user){
    // Here, Alice has permissions to create a blog post, but Bob does not.
    return getPrivilegesForUser(user).then(function(privs){
      return privs.can_create_blog_post === true;
    });
  };
  filter(promises, filterFn).then(function(users){
    // true, because the server told us only Alice can create a blog post.
    users.length === 1;
    // false, because Alice is the only user present in `users`
    users[0] === bob;
  });
  ```

/**
  `CoreObject` is the base class for all Ember constructs. It establishes a
  class system based on Ember's Mixin system, and provides the basis for the
  Ember Object Model. `CoreObject` should generally not be used directly,
  instead you should use `EmberObject`.

  ## Usage

  You can define a class by extending from `CoreObject` using the `extend`
  method:

  ```js
  const Person = CoreObject.extend({
    name: 'Tomster',
  });
  ```

  For detailed usage, see the [Object Model](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/object-model/)
  section of the guides.

  ## Usage with Native Classes

  Native JavaScript `class` syntax can be used to extend from any `CoreObject`
  based class:

  ```js
  class Person extends CoreObject {
    init() {
      super.init(...arguments);
      this.name = 'Tomster';
    }
  }
  ```

  Some notes about `class` usage:

  * `new` syntax is not currently supported with classes that extend from
    `EmberObject` or `CoreObject`. You must continue to use the `create` method
    when making new instances of classes, even if they are defined using native
    class syntax. If you want to use `new` syntax, consider creating classes
    which do _not_ extend from `EmberObject` or `CoreObject`. Ember features,
    such as computed properties and decorators, will still work with base-less
    classes.
  * Instead of using `this._super()`, you must use standard `super` syntax in
    native classes. See the [MDN docs on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Super_class_calls_with_super)
    for more details.
  * Native classes support using [constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Constructor)
    to set up newly-created instances. Ember uses these to, among other things,
    support features that need to retrieve other entities by name, like Service
    injection and `getOwner`. To ensure your custom instance setup logic takes
    place after this important work is done, avoid using the `constructor` in
    favor of `init`.
  * Properties passed to `create` will be available on the instance by the time
    `init` runs, so any code that requires these values should work at that
    time.
  * Using native classes, and switching back to the old Ember Object model is
    fully supported.

    in your `init` declaration!

  /**
    Defines the properties that will be concatenated from the superclass
    (instead of overridden).
     By default, when you extend an Ember class a property defined in
    the subclass overrides a property with the same name that is defined
    in the superclass. However, there are some cases where it is preferable
    to build up a property's value by combining the superclass' property
    value with the subclass' value. An example of this in use within Ember
    is the `classNames` property of `Component` from `@ember/component`.
     Here is some sample code showing the difference between a concatenated
    property and a normal one:
     ```javascript
    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';
     const Bar = EmberObject.extend({
      // Configure which properties to concatenate
      concatenatedProperties: ['concatenatedProperty'],
       someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['bar'],
      concatenatedProperty: ['bar']
    });
     const FooBar = Bar.extend({
      someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['foo'],
      concatenatedProperty: ['foo']
    });
     let fooBar = FooBar.create();
    fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['foo']
    fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo']
    ```
     This behavior extends to object creation as well. Continuing the
    above example:
     ```javascript
    let fooBar = FooBar.create({
      someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['baz'],
      concatenatedProperty: ['baz']
    })
    fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['baz']
    fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']
    ```
     Adding a single property that is not an array will just add it in the array:
     ```javascript
    let fooBar = FooBar.create({
      concatenatedProperty: 'baz'
    })
    view.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']
    ```
     Using the `concatenatedProperties` property, we can tell Ember to mix the
    content of the properties.
     In `Component` the `classNames`, `classNameBindings` and
    `attributeBindings` properties are concatenated.
     This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,
    although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently. Since
    it changes expectations about behavior of properties, you should properly
    document its usage in each individual concatenated property (to not
    mislead your users to think they can override the property in a subclass).
     @property concatenatedProperties
    @type Array
    @default null
    @public
  */

  /**
    Defines the properties that will be merged from the superclass
    (instead of overridden).
     By default, when you extend an Ember class a property defined in
    the subclass overrides a property with the same name that is defined
    in the superclass. However, there are some cases where it is preferable
    to build up a property's value by merging the superclass property value
    with the subclass property's value. An example of this in use within Ember
    is the `queryParams` property of routes.
     Here is some sample code showing the difference between a merged
    property and a normal one:
     ```javascript
    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';
     const Bar = EmberObject.extend({
      // Configure which properties are to be merged
      mergedProperties: ['mergedProperty'],
       someNonMergedProperty: {
        nonMerged: 'superclass value of nonMerged'
      },
      mergedProperty: {
        page: { replace: false },
        limit: { replace: true }
      }
    });
     const FooBar = Bar.extend({
      someNonMergedProperty: {
        completelyNonMerged: 'subclass value of nonMerged'
      },
      mergedProperty: {
        limit: { replace: false }
      }
    });
     let fooBar = FooBar.create();
     fooBar.get('someNonMergedProperty');
    // => { completelyNonMerged: 'subclass value of nonMerged' }
    //
    // Note the entire object, including the nonMerged property of
    // the superclass object, has been replaced
     fooBar.get('mergedProperty');
    // => {
    //   page: {replace: false},
    //   limit: {replace: false}
    // }
    //
    // Note the page remains from the superclass, and the
    // `limit` property's value of `false` has been merged from
    // the subclass.
    ```
     This behavior is not available during object `create` calls. It is only
    available at `extend` time.
     In `Route` the `queryParams` property is merged.
     This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,
    although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently. Since
    it changes expectations about behavior of properties, you should properly

     const Person = EmberObject.extend();
    person = Person.create();

     const Person = EmberObject.extend({
      say(thing) {
        alert(thing);
       }
    });
    ```
     This defines a new subclass of EmberObject: `Person`. It contains one method: `say()`.
     You can also create a subclass from any existing class by calling its `extend()` method.
    For example, you might want to create a subclass of Ember's built-in `Component` class:
     ```javascript
    import Component from '@ember/component';
     const PersonComponent = Component.extend({
      tagName: 'li',
      classNameBindings: ['isAdministrator']
    });
    ```
     When defining a subclass, you can override methods but still access the
    implementation of your parent class by calling the special `_super()` method:
     ```javascript
    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';
     const Person = EmberObject.extend({
      say(thing) {
        let name = this.get('name');
        alert(`${name} says: ${thing}`);
      }
    });
     const Soldier = Person.extend({
      say(thing) {
        this._super(`${thing}, sir!`);
      },
      march(numberOfHours) {
        alert(`${this.get('name')} marches for ${numberOfHours} hours.`);
      }
    });
     let yehuda = Soldier.create({
      name: 'Yehuda Katz'
    });
     yehuda.say('Yes');  // alerts "Yehuda Katz says: Yes, sir!"
    ```
     The `create()` on line #17 creates an *instance* of the `Soldier` class.
    The `extend()` on line #8 creates a *subclass* of `Person`. Any instance
    of the `Person` class will *not* have the `march()` method.
     You can also pass `Mixin` classes to add additional properties to the subclass.
     ```javascript
    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';
    import Mixin from '@ember/object/mixin';
     const Person = EmberObject.extend({
      say(thing) {
        alert(`${this.get('name')} says: ${thing}`);
      }
    });
     const SingingMixin = Mixin.create({
      sing(thing) {
        alert(`${this.get('name')} sings: la la la ${thing}`);
      }
    });
     const BroadwayStar = Person.extend(SingingMixin, {
      dance() {
        alert(`${this.get('name')} dances: tap tap tap tap `);
      }
    });
    ```
     The `BroadwayStar` class contains three methods: `say()`, `sing()`, and `dance()`.

    In some cases, you may want to annotate computed properties with additional

    example, computed property functions may close over variables that are then
    no longer available for introspection.
     You can pass a hash of these values to a computed property like this:
     ```javascript

    property from your class like this:
     ```javascript
    MyClass.metaForProperty('person');
    ```

/**
  The purpose of the Ember Instrumentation module is
  to provide efficient, general-purpose instrumentation
  for Ember.

  Subscribe to a listener by using `subscribe`:

  ```javascript
  import { subscribe } from '@ember/instrumentation';

  subscribe("render", {
    before(name, timestamp, payload) {

    },

    after(name, timestamp, payload) {

    }
  });
  ```

  If you return a value from the `before` callback, that same
  value will be passed as a fourth parameter to the `after`
  callback.

  Instrument a block of code by using `instrument`:

  ```javascript
  import { instrument } from '@ember/instrumentation';

  instrument("render.handlebars", payload, function() {
    // rendering logic
  }, binding);
  ```

  Event names passed to `instrument` are namespaced
  by periods, from more general to more specific. Subscribers
  can listen for events by whatever level of granularity they
  are interested in.

  In the above example, the event is `render.handlebars`,
  and the subscriber listened for all events beginning with
  `render`. It would receive callbacks for events named
  `render`, `render.handlebars`, `render.container`, or
  even `render.handlebars.layout`.

/**
  This mixin implements Observer-friendly Array-like behavior. It is not a
  concrete implementation, but it can be used up by other classes that want
  to appear like arrays.

  For example, ArrayProxy is a concrete class that can be instantiated to
  implement array-like behavior. This class uses the Array Mixin by way of
  the MutableArray mixin, which allows observable changes to be made to the
  underlying array.

  This mixin defines methods specifically for collections that provide
  index-ordered access to their contents. When you are designing code that
  needs to accept any kind of Array-like object, you should use these methods
  instead of Array primitives because these will properly notify observers of
  changes to the array.

  Although these methods are efficient, they do add a layer of indirection to
  your application so it is a good idea to use them only when you need the
  flexibility of using both true JavaScript arrays and "virtual" arrays such
  as controllers and collections.

  You can use the methods defined in this module to access and modify array
  contents in an observable-friendly way. You can also be notified whenever
  the membership of an array changes by using `.observes('myArray.[]')`.

  To support `EmberArray` in your own class, you must override two
  primitives to use it: `length()` and `objectAt()`.

  This mixin defines the API for modifying array-like objects. These methods

  It is important to use the methods in this class to modify arrays so that
  changes are observable. This allows the binding system in Ember to function

  Note that an Array can change even if it does not implement this mixin.

    @computed('person.fullName')
    get helloMessage() {
      return `Hello, ${this.person.fullName}!`;
    }
  }
  ```

  Classic Example:

  ```js
  import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
  import { dependentKeyCompat } from '@ember/object/compat';
  import EmberObject, { computed, observer, set } from '@ember/object';

  const Person = EmberObject.extend({
    firstName: tracked(),
    lastName: tracked(),

    fullName: dependentKeyCompat(function() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
    }),
  });

  const Profile = EmberObject.extend({
    person: null,

    helloMessage: computed('person.fullName', function() {
      return `Hello, ${this.person.fullName}!`;
    }),

    onNameUpdated: observer('person.fullName', function() {
      console.log('person name updated!');
    }),
  });
  ```

  `dependentKeyCompat()` can receive a getter function or an object containing
  `get`/`set` methods when used in classic classes, like computed properties.

  In general, only properties which you _expect_ to be watched by older,
  untracked clases should be marked as dependency compatible. The decorator is
  meant as an interop layer for parts of Ember's older classic APIs, and should
  not be applied to every possible getter/setter in classes. The number of
  dependency compatible getters should be _minimized_ wherever possible. New
  application code should not need to use `@dependentKeyCompat`, since it is
  only for interoperation with older code.

     1) A decision can be made to redirect elsewhere without
       needing to resolve the model first.
    2) Any async operations need to occur first before the
       model is attempted to be resolved.
     This hook is provided the current `transition` attempt
    as a parameter, which can be used to `.abort()` the transition,
    save it for a later `.retry()`, or retrieve values set
    on it from a previous hook. You can also just call
    `router.transitionTo` to another route to implicitly
    abort the `transition`.
     You can return a promise from this hook to pause the
    transition until the promise resolves (or rejects). This could
    be useful, for instance, for retrieving async code from
    the server that is required to enter a route.

    but is provided the route's resolved model in addition to
    the `transition`, and is therefore suited to performing
    logic that can only take place after the model has already
    resolved.
     ```app/routes/posts.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';

     `redirect` and `afterModel` behave very similarly and are

    distinction when calling `this.router.transitionTo` to a child route
    of the current route. From `afterModel`, this new transition
    invalidates the current transition, causing `beforeModel`,

    same transition started from `redirect` does _not_ invalidate
    the current transition. In other words, by the time the `redirect`

    entry into this route are considered fully validated.

     Router.map(function() {
      this.route('post', { path: '/posts/:post_id' });
    });
     export default Router;
    ```
     Note that for routes with dynamic segments, this hook is not always
    executed. If the route is entered through a transition (e.g. when
    using the `link-to` Handlebars helper or the `transitionTo` method
    of routes), and a model context is already provided this hook
    is not called.
     A model context does not include a primitive string or number,
    which does cause the model hook to be called.
     Routes without dynamic segments will always execute the model hook.
     ```javascript
    // no dynamic segment, model hook always called
    this.router.transitionTo('posts');
     // model passed in, so model hook not called
    thePost = store.findRecord('post', 1);
    this.router.transitionTo('post', thePost);
     // integer passed in, model hook is called
    this.router.transitionTo('post', 1);
     // model id passed in, model hook is called
    // useful for forcing the hook to execute
    thePost = store.findRecord('post', 1);
    this.router.transitionTo('post', thePost.id);
    ```
     This hook follows the asynchronous/promise semantics
    described in the documentation for `beforeModel`. In particular,
    if a promise returned from `model` fails, the error will be
    handled by the `error` hook on `Route`.
     Note that the legacy behavior of automatically defining a model
    hook when a dynamic segment ending in `_id` is present is
    [deprecated](https://deprecations.emberjs.com/v5.x#toc_deprecate-implicit-route-model).
    You should explicitly define a model hook whenever any segments are

  /**
    A hook you can use to setup the controller for the current route.
     This method is called with the controller for the current route and the
    model supplied by the `model` hook.
     By default, the `setupController` hook sets the `model` property of
    the controller to the specified `model` when it is not `undefined`.
     If you implement the `setupController` hook in your Route, it will
    prevent this default behavior. If you want to preserve that behavior
    when implementing your `setupController` function, make sure to call
    `super`:
     ```app/routes/photos.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
    import { service } from '@ember/service';
     export default class PhotosRoute extends Route {
      @service store;
       model() {
        return this.store.findAll('photo');
      }
       setupController(controller, model) {
        super.setupController(controller, model);
         this.controllerFor('application').set('showingPhotos', true);
      }
    }
    ```
     The provided controller will be one resolved based on the name
    of this route.
     If no explicit controller is defined, Ember will automatically create one.
     As an example, consider the router:
     ```app/router.js
    // ...
     Router.map(function() {
      this.route('post', { path: '/posts/:post_id' });
    });
     export default Router;
    ```
     If you have defined a file for the post controller,
    the framework will use it.
    If it is not defined, a basic `Controller` instance would be used.
     @example Behavior of a basic Controller
     ```app/routes/post.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
     export default class PostRoute extends Route {
      setupController(controller, model) {

    The `Router.map` function allows you to define mappings from URLs to routes
    in your application. These mappings are defined within the
    supplied callback function using `this.route`.
     The first parameter is the name of the route which is used by default as the
    path name as well.
     The second parameter is the optional options hash. Available options are:
       * `path`: allows you to provide your own path as well as mark dynamic
        segments.
      * `resetNamespace`: false by default; when nesting routes, ember will
        combine the route names to form the fully-qualified route name, which is
        used with `{{link-to}}` or manually transitioning to routes. Setting
        `resetNamespace: true` will cause the route not to inherit from its
        parent route's names. This is handy for preventing extremely long route names.
        Keep in mind that the actual URL path behavior is still retained.
     The third parameter is a function, which can be used to nest routes.
    Nested routes, by default, will have the parent route tree's route name and
    path prepended to it's own.

/**
  HistoryLocation implements the location API using the browser's
  history.pushState API.

  Using `HistoryLocation` results in URLs that are indistinguishable from a
  standard URL. This relies upon the browser's `history` API.

  Example:

  ```app/router.js
  Router.map(function() {
    this.route('posts', function() {
      this.route('new');
    });
  });

  Router.reopen({
    location: 'history'
  });
  ```

  This will result in a posts.new url of `/posts/new`.

  Keep in mind that your server must serve the Ember app at all the routes you
  define.

  Using `HistoryLocation` will also result in location states being recorded by
  the browser `history` API with the following schema:

  ```
  window.history.state -> { path: '/', uuid: '3552e730-b4a6-46bd-b8bf-d8c3c1a97e0a' }
  ```

  This allows each in-app location state to be tracked uniquely across history
  state changes via the `uuid` field.

/*
  To add a deprecation, you must add a new entry to the `DEPRECATIONS` object.
  The entry should be an object with the following properties:

  * `id` (required): A string that uniquely identifies the deprecation. This
    should be a short, descriptive name, typically dasherized.
  * `for` (required): The string `ember-source` -- every deprecation from this
    package is for `ember-source`.
  * `since` (required): An object with `available` and `enabled`. `available` is
    the first version of Ember that the deprecation is available in. `enabled` is
    the version of Ember that the deprecation was first enabled. This is used as
    a feature flag deprecations. For public APIs, the `enabled` value is added
    only once the deprecation RFC is [Ready for Release](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs#ready-for-release).
  * `until` (required): The version of Ember that the deprecation will be removed
  * `url` (required): A URL to the deprecation guide for the deprecation. This
    URL can be constructed in advance of the deprecation being added to the
    [deprecation app](https://github.com/ember-learn/deprecation-app) by
    following this format: `https://deprecations.emberjs.com/deprecations/{{id}}`.

  For example:
  `deprecate` should then be called using the entry from the `DEPRECATIONS` object.

  ```ts
  import { DEPRECATIONS } from '@ember/-internals/deprecations';
  //...

  deprecateUntil(message, DEPRECATIONS.MY_DEPRECATION);
  ```

  `expectDeprecation` should also use the DEPRECATIONS object, but it should be noted
  that it uses `isEnabled` instead of `test` because the expectations of `expectDeprecation`
  are the opposite of `test`.

  ```ts
  expectDeprecation(
    () => {
        assert.equal(foo, bar(), 'foo is equal to bar'); // something that triggers the deprecation
    },
    /matchesMessage/,
    DEPRECATIONS.MY_DEPRECATION.isEnabled
  );
  ```

  Tests can be conditionally run based on whether a deprecation is enabled or not:

  ```ts
    [`${testUnless(DEPRECATIONS.MY_DEPRECATION.isRemoved)} specific deprecated feature tested only in this test`]
  ```

  This test will be skipped when the MY_DEPRECATION is removed.
  When adding a deprecation, we need to guard all the code that will eventually be removed, including tests.
  For tests that are not specifically testing the deprecated feature, we need to figure out how to
  test the behavior without encountering the deprecated feature, just as users would.

     This is most commonly used to manage redirects in a way that does not cause confusing additions

/**
 * A convenience for pushing some arguments on the stack and
 * running some code if the code needs to be re-executed during
 * updating execution if some of the arguments have changed.
 *
 * # Initial Execution
 *
 * The `args` function should push zero or more arguments onto
 * the stack and return the number of arguments pushed.
 *
 * The `body` function provides the instructions to execute both
 * during initial execution and during updating execution.
 *
 * Internally, this function starts by pushing a new frame, so
 * that the body can return and sets the return point ($ra) to
 * the ENDINITIAL label.
 *
 * It then executes the `args` function, which adds instructions
 * responsible for pushing the arguments for the block to the
 * stack. These arguments will be restored to the stack before
 * updating execution.
 *
 * Next, it adds the Enter opcode, which marks the current position
 * in the DOM, and remembers the current $pc (the next instruction)
 * as the first instruction to execute during updating execution.
 *
 * Next, it runs `body`, which adds the opcodes that should
 * execute both during initial execution and during updating execution.
 * If the `body` wishes to finish early, it should Jump to the
 * `FINALLY` label.
 *
 * Next, it adds the FINALLY label, followed by:
 *
 * - the Exit opcode, which finalizes the marked DOM started by the
 *   Enter opcode.
 * - the Return opcode, which returns to the current return point
 *   ($ra).
 *
 * Finally, it adds the ENDINITIAL label followed by the PopFrame
 * instruction, which restores $fp, $sp and $ra.
 *
 * # Updating Execution
 *
 * Updating execution for this `replayable` occurs if the `body` added an
 * assertion, via one of the `JumpIf`, `JumpUnless` or `AssertSame` opcodes.
 *
 * If, during updating executon, the assertion fails, the initial VM is
 * restored, and the stored arguments are pushed onto the stack. The DOM
 * between the starting and ending markers is cleared, and the VM's cursor
 * is set to the area just cleared.
 *
 * The return point ($ra) is set to -1, the exit instruction.
 *
 * Finally, the $pc is set to to the instruction saved off by the
 * Enter opcode during initial execution, and execution proceeds as
 * usual.
 *
 * The only difference is that when a `Return` instruction is
 * encountered, the program jumps to -1 rather than the END label,
 * and the PopFrame opcode is not needed.

 * The Program Heap is responsible for dynamically allocating

 * regions of the memory in an int array known as the table.
 *
 * The table 32-bit aligned and has the following layout:
 *
 * | ... | hp (u32) |       info (u32)   | size (u32) |
 * | ... |  Handle  | Scope Size | State | Size       |
 * | ... | 32bits   | 30bits     | 2bits | 32bit      |
 *
 * With this information we effectively have the ability to
 * control when we want to free memory. That being said you
 * can not free during execution as raw address are only
 * valid during the execution. This means you cannot close
 * over them as you will have a bad memory access exception.

/**
  This utility function is used to declare a given component has no backing class. When the rendering engine detects this it
  is able to perform a number of optimizations. Templates that are associated with `templateOnly()` will be rendered _as is_
  without adding a wrapping `<div>` (or any of the other element customization behaviors of [@ember/component](/ember/release/classes/Component)).
  Specifically, this means that the template will be rendered as "outer HTML".

  In general, this method will be used by build time tooling and would not be directly written in an application. However,
  at times it may be useful to use directly to leverage the "outer HTML" semantics mentioned above. For example, if an addon would like
  to use these semantics for its templates but cannot be certain it will only be consumed by applications that have enabled the
  `template-only-glimmer-components` optional feature.

  @example

  ```js
  import { templateOnlyComponent } from '@glimmer/runtime';

  export default templateOnlyComponent();
  ```

// Browsers: Safari, IE, Edge, Firefox ~33-34
// Reason:   insertAdjacentHTML does not exist on SVG elements in Safari. It is
//           present but throws an exception on IE and Edge. Old versions of
//           Firefox create nodes in the incorrect namespace.
// Fix:      Since IE and Edge silently fail to create SVG nodes using
//           innerHTML, and because Firefox may create nodes in the incorrect
//           namespace using innerHTML on SVG elements, an HTML-string wrapping
//           approach is used. A pre/post SVG tag is added to the string, then
//           that whole string is added to a div. The created nodes are plucked
//           out and applied to the target location on DOM.

  // Patch:    Adjacent text node merging fix
  // Browsers: IE, Edge, Firefox w/o inspector open

  //           <div>Hello</div> with div.insertAdjacentHTML(' world') browsers
  //           with proper behavior will populate div.childNodes with two items.
  //           These browsers will populate it with one merged node instead.
  // Fix:      Add these nodes to a wrapper element, then iterate the childNodes
  //           of that wrapper and move the nodes to their target location. Note
  //           that potential SVG bugs will have been handled before this fix.
  //           Note that this fix must only apply to the previous text node, as
  //           the base implementation of `insertHTMLBefore` already handles
  //           following text nodes correctly.

      Dynamically look up a property on an object. The second argument to `{{get}}`
      should have a string value, although it can be bound.
      For example, these two usages are equivalent:
      ```app/components/developer-detail.js
      import Component from '@glimmer/component';
      import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
      export default class extends Component {

      }
      ```
      ```handlebars
      {{this.developer.name}}
      {{get this.developer "name"}}
      ```
      If there were several facts about a person, the `{{get}}` helper can dynamically
      pick one:
      ```app/templates/application.hbs
      <DeveloperDetail @factName="language" />
      ```
      ```handlebars
      {{get this.developer @factName}}
      ```
      For a more complex example, this template would allow the user to switch
      between showing the user's height and weight with a click:
      ```app/components/developer-detail.js
      import Component from '@glimmer/component';
      import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';
      export default class extends Component {
      @tracked developer = {
      name: "Sandi Metz",
      language: "Ruby"
      }
      @tracked currentFact = 'name'
      showFact = (fact) => {
      this.currentFact = fact;
      }
      }
      ```
      ```app/components/developer-detail.js
      {{get this.developer this.currentFact}}
      <button {{on 'click' (fn this.showFact "name")}}>Show name</button>
      <button {{on 'click' (fn this.showFact "language")}}>Show language</button>
      ```
      The `{{get}}` helper can also respect mutable values itself. For example:
      ```app/components/developer-detail.js
      <Input @value={{mut (get this.person this.currentFact)}} />
      <button {{on 'click' (fn this.showFact "name")}}>Show name</button>
      <button {{on 'click' (fn this.showFact "language")}}>Show language</button>
      ```
      Would allow the user to swap what fact is being displayed, and also edit
      that fact via a two-way mutable binding.

      The `{{on}}` modifier lets you easily add event listeners (it uses
      [EventTarget.addEventListener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)
      internally).
      For example, if you'd like to run a function on your component when a `<button>`
      in the components template is clicked you might do something like:
      ```app/components/like-post.hbs
      <button {{on 'click' this.saveLike}}>Like this post!</button>
      ```
      ```app/components/like-post.js
      import Component from '@glimmer/component';
      import { action } from '@ember/object';
      export default class LikePostComponent extends Component {
      saveLike = () => {
      // someone likes your post!
      // better send a request off to your server...
      }
      }
      ```
      ### Arguments
      `{{on}}` accepts two positional arguments, and a few named arguments.
      The positional arguments are:
      - `event` -- the name to use when calling `addEventListener`
      - `callback` -- the function to be passed to `addEventListener`
      The named arguments are:
      - capture -- a `true` value indicates that events of this type will be dispatched
      to the registered listener before being dispatched to any EventTarget beneath it
      in the DOM tree.
      - once -- indicates that the listener should be invoked at most once after being
      added. If true, the listener would be automatically removed when invoked.
      - passive -- if `true`, indicates that the function specified by listener will never
      call preventDefault(). If a passive listener does call preventDefault(), the user
      agent will do nothing other than generate a console warning. See
      [Improving scrolling performance with passive listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#Improving_scrolling_performance_with_passive_listeners)
      to learn more.
      The callback function passed to `{{on}}` will receive any arguments that are passed
      to the event handler. Most commonly this would be the `event` itself.
      If you would like to pass additional arguments to the function you should use
      the `{{fn}}` helper.
      For example, in our example case above if you'd like to pass in the post that
      was being liked when the button is clicked you could do something like:
      ```app/components/like-post.hbs
      <button {{on 'click' (fn this.saveLike @post)}}>Like this post!</button>
      ```
      In this case, the `saveLike` function will receive two arguments: the click event
      and the value of `@post`.
      ### Function Context
      In the example above, we used an arrow function to ensure that `likePost` is
      properly bound to the `items-list`, but let's explore what happens if we
      left out the arrow function:
      ```app/components/like-post.js
      import Component from '@glimmer/component';
      export default class LikePostComponent extends Component {
      saveLike() {
      // ...snip...
      }
      }
      ```
      In this example, when the button is clicked `saveLike` will be invoked,
      it will **not** have access to the component instance. In other
      words, it will have no `this` context, so please make sure your functions
      are bound (via an arrow function or other means) before passing into `on`!

/**
  The `Input` component lets you create an HTML `<input>` element.

  ```handlebars
  <Input @value="987" />
  ```

  creates an `<input>` element with `type="text"` and value set to 987.

  ### Text field

  If no `type` argument is specified, a default of type 'text' is used.

  ```handlebars
  Search:
  <Input @value={{this.searchWord}} />
  ```

  In this example, the initial value in the `<input>` will be set to the value of
  `this.searchWord`. If the user changes the text, the value of `this.searchWord` will also be
  updated.

  ### Actions

  The `Input` component takes a number of arguments with callbacks that are invoked in response to
  user events.

  * `enter`
  * `insert-newline`
  * `escape-press`
  * `focus-in`
  * `focus-out`
  * `key-down`
  * `key-press`
  * `key-up`

  These callbacks are passed to `Input` like this:

  ```handlebars
  <Input @value={{this.searchWord}} @enter={{this.query}} />
  ```

  Starting with Ember Octane, we recommend using the `{{on}}` modifier to call actions
  on specific events, such as the input event.

  ```handlebars
  <label for="input-name">Name:</label>
  <Input
    @id="input-name"
    @value={{this.name}}
    {{on "input" this.validateName}}
  />
  ```

  The event name (e.g. `focusout`, `input`, `keydown`) always follows the casing
  that the HTML standard uses.

  ### `<input>` HTML Attributes to Avoid

  In most cases, if you want to pass an attribute to the underlying HTML `<input>` element, you
  can pass the attribute directly, just like any other Ember component.

  ```handlebars
  <Input @type="text" size="10" />
  ```

  In this example, the `size` attribute will be applied to the underlying `<input>` element in the
  outputted HTML.

  However, there are a few attributes where you **must** use the `@` version.

  * `@type`: This argument is used to control which Ember component is used under the hood
  * `@value`: The `@value` argument installs a two-way binding onto the element. If you wanted a
    one-way binding, use `<input>` with the `value` property and the `input` event instead.
  * `@checked` (for checkboxes): like `@value`, the `@checked` argument installs a two-way binding
    onto the element. If you wanted a one-way binding, use `<input type="checkbox">` with
    `checked` and the `input` event instead.

  ### Checkbox

  To create an `<input type="checkbox">`:

  ```handlebars
  Emberize Everything:
  <Input @type="checkbox" @checked={{this.isEmberized}} name="isEmberized" />
  ```

  This will bind the checked state of this checkbox to the value of `isEmberized` -- if either one
  changes, it will be reflected in the other.

/**
  The `LinkTo` component renders a link to the supplied `routeName` passing an optionally
  supplied model to the route as its `model` context of the route. The block for `LinkTo`
  becomes the contents of the rendered element:

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery'>
    Great Hamster Photos
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  This will result in:

  ```html
  <a href="/hamster-photos">
    Great Hamster Photos
  </a>
  ```

  ### Disabling the `LinkTo` component

  The `LinkTo` component can be disabled by using the `disabled` argument. A disabled link
  doesn't result in a transition when activated, and adds the `disabled` class to the `<a>`
  element.

  (The class name to apply to the element can be overridden by using the `disabledClass`
  argument)

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @disabled={{true}}>
    Great Hamster Photos
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  ### Handling `href`

  `<LinkTo>` will use your application's Router to fill the element's `href` property with a URL
  that matches the path to the supplied `routeName`.

  ### Handling current route

  The `LinkTo` component will apply a CSS class name of 'active' when the application's current
  route matches the supplied routeName. For example, if the application's current route is
  'photoGallery.recent', then the following invocation of `LinkTo`:

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.recent'>
    Great Hamster Photos
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  will result in

  ```html
  <a href="/hamster-photos/this-week" class="active">
    Great Hamster Photos
  </a>
  ```

  The CSS class used for active classes can be customized by passing an `activeClass` argument:

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.recent' @activeClass="current-url">
    Great Hamster Photos
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  ```html
  <a href="/hamster-photos/this-week" class="current-url">
    Great Hamster Photos
  </a>
  ```

  ### Keeping a link active for other routes

  If you need a link to be 'active' even when it doesn't match the current route, you can use the
  `current-when` argument.

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @current-when='photos'>
    Photo Gallery
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  This may be helpful for keeping links active for:

  * non-nested routes that are logically related
  * some secondary menu approaches
  * 'top navigation' with 'sub navigation' scenarios

  A link will be active if `current-when` is `true` or the current
  route is the route this link would transition to.

  To match multiple routes 'space-separate' the routes:

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='gallery' @current-when='photos drawings paintings'>
    Art Gallery
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  ### Supplying a model

  An optional `model` argument can be used for routes whose
  paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become
  the model context of the linked route:

  ```javascript
  Router.map(function() {
    this.route("photoGallery", {path: "hamster-photos/:photo_id"});
  });
  ```

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @model={{this.aPhoto}}>
    {{aPhoto.title}}
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  ```html
  <a href="/hamster-photos/42">
    Tomster
  </a>
  ```

  ### Supplying multiple models

  For deep-linking to route paths that contain multiple
  dynamic segments, the `models` argument can be used.

  As the router transitions through the route path, each
  supplied model argument will become the context for the
  route with the dynamic segments:

  ```javascript
  Router.map(function() {
    this.route("photoGallery", { path: "hamster-photos/:photo_id" }, function() {
      this.route("comment", {path: "comments/:comment_id"});
    });
  });
  ```

  This argument will become the model context of the linked route:

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.comment' @models={{array this.aPhoto this.comment}}>
    {{comment.body}}
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  ```html
  <a href="/hamster-photos/42/comments/718">
    A+++ would snuggle again.
  </a>
  ```

  ### Supplying an explicit dynamic segment value

  If you don't have a model object available to pass to `LinkTo`,
  an optional string or integer argument can be passed for routes whose
  paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become the value
  of the dynamic segment:

  ```javascript
  Router.map(function() {
    this.route("photoGallery", { path: "hamster-photos/:photo_id" });
  });
  ```

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @model={{aPhotoId}}>
    {{this.aPhoto.title}}
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  ```html
  <a href="/hamster-photos/42">
    Tomster
  </a>
  ```

  When transitioning into the linked route, the `model` hook will
  be triggered with parameters including this passed identifier.

  ### Supplying query parameters

  If you need to add optional key-value pairs that appear to the right of the ? in a URL,
  you can use the `query` argument.

  ```handlebars
  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @query={{hash page=1 per_page=20}}>
    Great Hamster Photos
  </LinkTo>
  ```

  This will result in:

  ```html
  <a href="/hamster-photos?page=1&per_page=20">
    Great Hamster Photos
  </a>
  ```

/**
  A component is a reusable UI element that consists of a `.hbs` template and an
  optional JavaScript class that defines its behavior. For example, someone
  might make a `button` in the template and handle the click behavior in the
  JavaScript file that shares the same name as the template.

  Components are broken down into two categories:

  - Components _without_ JavaScript, that are based only on a template. These
    are called Template-only or TO components.
  - Components _with_ JavaScript, which consist of a template and a backing
    class.

  Ember ships with two types of JavaScript classes for components:

  1. Glimmer components, imported from `@glimmer/component`, which are the
     default component's for Ember Octane (3.15) and more recent editions.
  2. Classic components, imported from `@ember/component`, which were the
     default for older editions of Ember (pre 3.15).

  Below is the documentation for Classic components. If you are looking for the
  API documentation for Template-only or Glimmer components, it is [available
  here](/ember/release/modules/@glimmer%2Fcomponent).

  ## Defining a Classic Component

  If you want to customize the component in order to handle events, transform
  arguments or maintain internal state, you implement a subclass of `Component`.

  One example is to add computed properties to your component:

  ```app/components/person-profile.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    @computed('person.title', 'person.firstName', 'person.lastName')
    get displayName() {
      let { title, firstName, lastName } = this.person;

      if (title) {
        return `${title} ${lastName}`;
      } else {
        return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  And then use it in the component's template:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{this.displayName}}</h1>
  {{yield}}
  ```

  ## Customizing a Classic Component's HTML Element in JavaScript

  ### HTML Tag

  The default HTML tag name used for a component's HTML representation is `div`.
  This can be customized by setting the `tagName` property.

  Consider the following component class:

  ```app/components/emphasized-paragraph.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'em';
  }
  ```

  When invoked, this component would produce output that looks something like
  this:

  ```html
  <em id="ember1" class="ember-view"></em>
  ```

  ### HTML `class` Attribute

  The HTML `class` attribute of a component's tag can be set by providing a
  `classNames` property that is set to an array of strings:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNames = ['my-class', 'my-other-class'];
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce output that looks like this:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view my-class my-other-class"></div>
  ```

  `class` attribute values can also be set by providing a `classNameBindings`
  property set to an array of properties names for the component. The return
  value of these properties will be added as part of the value for the
  components's `class` attribute. These properties can be computed properties:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';
  import { computed } from '@ember/object';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNames = ['my-class', 'my-other-class'];
    classNameBindings = ['propertyA', 'propertyB'];

    propertyA = 'from-a';

    get propertyB {
      if (someLogic) { return 'from-b'; }
    }
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view my-class my-other-class from-a from-b"></div>
  ```

  Note that `classNames` and `classNameBindings` is in addition to the `class`
  attribute passed with the angle bracket invocation syntax. Therefore, if this
  component was invoked like so:

  ```handlebars
  <MyWidget class="from-invocation" />
  ```

  The resulting HTML will look similar to this:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="from-invocation ember-view my-class my-other-class from-a from-b"></div>
  ```

  If the value of a class name binding returns a boolean the property name
  itself will be used as the class name if the property is true. The class name
  will not be added if the value is `false` or `undefined`.

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['hovered'];

    hovered = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view hovered"></div>
  ```

  ### Custom Class Names for Boolean Values

  When using boolean class name bindings you can supply a string value other
  than the property name for use as the `class` HTML attribute by appending the
  preferred value after a ":" character when defining the binding:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['awesome:so-very-cool'];

    awesome = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view so-very-cool"></div>
  ```

  Boolean value class name bindings whose property names are in a
  camelCase-style format will be converted to a dasherized format:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['isUrgent'];

    isUrgent = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view is-urgent"></div>
  ```

  Class name bindings can also refer to object values that are found by
  traversing a path relative to the component itself:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';
  import EmberObject from '@ember/object';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['messages.empty'];

    messages = EmberObject.create({
      empty: true
    });
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view empty"></div>
  ```

  If you want to add a class name for a property which evaluates to true and and
  a different class name if it evaluates to false, you can pass a binding like
  this:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled'];

    isEnabled = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view enabled"></div>
  ```

  When isEnabled is `false`, the resulting HTML representation looks like this:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view disabled"></div>
  ```

  This syntax offers the convenience to add a class if a property is `false`:

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  // Applies no class when isEnabled is true and class 'disabled' when isEnabled is false
  export default class extends Component {
    classNameBindings = ['isEnabled::disabled'];

    isEnabled = true;
  }
  ```

  Invoking this component when the `isEnabled` property is true will produce
  HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view"></div>
  ```

  Invoking it when the `isEnabled` property on the component is `false` will
  produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <div id="ember1" class="ember-view disabled"></div>
  ```

  Updates to the value of a class name binding will result in automatic update
  of the  HTML `class` attribute in the component's rendered HTML
  representation. If the value becomes `false` or `undefined` the class name
  will be removed.

  Both `classNames` and `classNameBindings` are concatenated properties. See
  [EmberObject](/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more
  information about concatenated properties.

  ### Other HTML Attributes

  The HTML attribute section of a component's tag can be set by providing an
  `attributeBindings` property set to an array of property names on the
  component. The return value of these properties will be used as the value of
  the component's HTML associated attribute:

  ```app/components/my-anchor.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'a';
    attributeBindings = ['href'];

    href = 'http://google.com';
  };
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <a id="ember1" class="ember-view" href="http://google.com"></a>
  ```

  One property can be mapped on to another by placing a ":" between the source
  property and the destination property:

  ```app/components/my-anchor.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'a';
    attributeBindings = ['url:href'];

    url = 'http://google.com';
  };
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <a id="ember1" class="ember-view" href="http://google.com"></a>
  ```

  HTML attributes passed with angle bracket invocations will take precedence
  over those specified in `attributeBindings`. Therefore, if this component was
  invoked like so:

  ```handlebars
  <MyAnchor href="http://bing.com" @url="http://google.com" />
  ```

  The resulting HTML will looks like this:

  ```html
  <a id="ember1" class="ember-view" href="http://bing.com"></a>
  ```

  Note that the `href` attribute is ultimately set to `http://bing.com`, despite
  it having attribute binidng to the `url` property, which was set to
  `http://google.com`.

  Namespaced attributes (e.g. `xlink:href`) are supported, but have to be
  mapped, since `:` is not a valid character for properties in Javascript:

  ```app/components/my-use.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'use';
    attributeBindings = ['xlinkHref:xlink:href'];

    xlinkHref = '#triangle';
  };
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <use xlink:href="#triangle"></use>
  ```

  If the value of a property monitored by `attributeBindings` is a boolean, the
  attribute will be present or absent depending on the value:

  ```app/components/my-text-input.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'input';
    attributeBindings = ['disabled'];

    disabled = false;
  };
  ```

  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:

  ```html
  <input id="ember1" class="ember-view" />
  ```

  `attributeBindings` can refer to computed properties:

  ```app/components/my-text-input.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';
  import { computed } from '@ember/object';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'input';
    attributeBindings = ['disabled'];

    get disabled() {
      if (someLogic) {
        return true;
      } else {
        return false;
      }
    }
  };
  ```

  To prevent setting an attribute altogether, use `null` or `undefined` as the
  value of the property used in `attributeBindings`:

  ```app/components/my-text-input.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    tagName = 'form';
    attributeBindings = ['novalidate'];
    novalidate = null;
  };
  ```

  Updates to the property of an attribute binding will result in automatic
  update of the  HTML attribute in the component's HTML output.

  `attributeBindings` is a concatenated property. See
  [EmberObject](/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more
  information about concatenated properties.

  ## Layouts

  The `layout` property can be used to dynamically specify a template associated
  with a component class, instead of relying on Ember to link together a
  component class and a template based on file names.

  In general, applications should not use this feature, but it's commonly used
  in addons for historical reasons.

  The `layout` property should be set to the default export of a template
  module, which is the name of a template file without the `.hbs` extension.

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>Person's Title</h1>
  <div class='details'>{{yield}}</div>
  ```

  ```app/components/person-profile.js
    import Component from '@ember/component';
    import layout from '../templates/components/person-profile';

    export default class extends Component {
      layout = layout;
    }
  ```

  If you invoke the component:

  ```handlebars
  <PersonProfile>
    <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>
    <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>
  </PersonProfile>
  ```

  or

  ```handlebars
  {{#person-profile}}
    <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>
    <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>
  {{/person-profile}}
  ```

  It will result in the following HTML output:

  ```html
  <h1>Person's Title</h1>
    <div class="details">
    <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>
    <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>
  </div>
  ```

  ## Handling Browser Events

  There are two ways to handle user-initiated events:

  ### Using the `on` modifier to capture browser events

  In a component's template, you can attach an event handler to any element with the `on` modifier:

  ```handlebars
  <button {{on 'click' this.doSomething}} />
  ```

  This will call the function on your component:

  ```js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class ExampleComponent extends Component {
    doSomething = (event) => {
      // `event` is the native click Event
      console.log('clicked on the button');
    };
  }
  ```

  See the [Guide on Component event
  handlers](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/component-state-and-actions/#toc_html-modifiers-and-actions)
  and the [API docs for `on`](../Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/on?anchor=on)
  for more details.

  ### Event Handler Methods

  Components can also respond to user-initiated events by implementing a method
  that matches the event name. This approach is appropriate when the same event
  should be handled by all instances of the same component.

  An event object will be passed as the argument to the event handler method.

  ```app/components/my-widget.js
  import Component from '@ember/component';

  export default class extends Component {
    click(event) {
      // `event.target` is either the component's element or one of its children
      let tag = event.target.tagName.toLowerCase();
      console.log('clicked on a `<${tag}>` HTML element!');
    }
  }
  ```

  In this example, whenever the user clicked anywhere inside the component, it
  will log a message to the console.

  It is possible to handle event types other than `click` by implementing the
  following event handler methods. In addition, custom events can be registered
  by using `Application.customEvents`.

  Touch events:

  * `touchStart`
  * `touchMove`
  * `touchEnd`
  * `touchCancel`

  Keyboard events:

  * `keyDown`
  * `keyUp`
  * `keyPress`

  Mouse events:

  * `mouseDown`
  * `mouseUp`
  * `contextMenu`
  * `click`
  * `doubleClick`
  * `focusIn`
  * `focusOut`

  Form events:

  * `submit`
  * `change`
  * `focusIn`
  * `focusOut`
  * `input`

  Drag and drop events:

  * `dragStart`
  * `drag`
  * `dragEnter`
  * `dragLeave`
  * `dragOver`
  * `dragEnd`
  * `drop`

    Component.extend({
      classNameBindings: ['isUrgent'],
      isUrgent: true
    });

     If you would prefer to use a custom value instead of the dasherized
    property name, you can pass a binding like this:
     ```javascript
    // Applies the 'urgent' class to the view element
    import Component from '@ember/component';
    Component.extend({
      classNameBindings: ['isUrgent:urgent'],
      isUrgent: true
    });
    ```
     If you would like to specify a class that should only be added when the
    property is false, you can declare a binding like this:
     ```javascript
    // Applies the 'disabled' class to the view element
    import Component from '@ember/component';
    Component.extend({
      classNameBindings: ['isEnabled::disabled'],

  /**
    Normally, Ember's component model is "write-only". The component takes a
    bunch of attributes that it got passed in, and uses them to render its
    template.
     One nice thing about this model is that if you try to set a value to the
    same thing as last time, Ember (through HTMLBars) will avoid doing any
    work on the DOM.
     This is not just a performance optimization. If an attribute has not
    changed, it is important not to clobber the element's "hidden state".
    For example, if you set an input's `value` to the same value as before,
    it will clobber selection state and cursor position. In other words,
    setting an attribute is not **always** idempotent.
     This method provides a way to read an element's attribute and also
    update the last value Ember knows about at the same time. This makes
    setting an attribute idempotent.
     In particular, what this means is that if you get an `<input>` element's
    `value` attribute and then re-render the template with the same value,
    it will avoid clobbering the cursor and selection position.
    Since most attribute sets are idempotent in the browser, you typically
    can get away with reading attributes using jQuery, but the most reliable
    way to do so is through this method.
    @method readDOMAttr
     @param {String} name the name of the attribute

  // --- Declarations which support mixins ---
  // We use `declare` on these properties, even though they are optional, so
  // that they do not get created on the class *at all* when emitting the
  // transpiled code. Otherwise, since declared class properties are equivalent
  // to calling `defineProperty` in the class constructor, they would "stomp"
  // the properties supplied by mixins.

  /**
   A list of properties of the view to apply as attributes. If the property
   is a string value, the value of that string will be applied as the value
   for an attribute of the property's name.
    The following example creates a tag like `<div priority="high" />`.
    ```app/components/my-component.js
   import Component from '@ember/component';
    export default Component.extend({
      attributeBindings: ['priority'],
      priority: 'high'
    });
   ```
    If the value of the property is a Boolean, the attribute is treated as
   an HTML Boolean attribute. It will be present if the property is `true`
   and omitted if the property is `false`.
    The following example creates markup like `<div visible />`.
    ```app/components/my-component.js
   import Component from '@ember/component';
    export default Component.extend({
      attributeBindings: ['visible'],
      visible: true
    });
   ```
    If you would prefer to use a custom value instead of the property name,
   you can create the same markup as the last example with a binding like
   this:
    ```app/components/my-component.js
   import Component from '@ember/component';
    export default Component.extend({
      attributeBindings: ['isVisible:visible'],

  Ember Helpers are functions that can compute values, and are used in templates.
  For example, this code calls a helper named `format-currency`:

  ```app/templates/application.hbs
  <Cost @cents={{230}} />
  ```

  ```app/components/cost.hbs
  <div>{{format-currency @cents currency="$"}}</div>
  ```

  Additionally a helper can be called as a nested helper.
  In this example, we show the formatted currency value if the `showMoney`
  named argument is truthy.

  ```handlebars
  {{if @showMoney (format-currency @cents currency="$")}}
  ```

  Helpers defined using a class must provide a `compute` function. For example:

  ```app/helpers/format-currency.js
  import Helper from '@ember/component/helper';

  export default class extends Helper {
    compute([cents], { currency }) {
      return `${currency}${cents * 0.01}`;
    }
  }
  ```

  Each time the input to a helper changes, the `compute` function will be
  called again.

  As instances, these helpers also have access to the container and will accept
  injected dependencies.

  Additionally, class helpers can call `recompute` to force a new computation.

 * @note This is *not* user-constructible: it is exported only so that the type

 */
// Making `FunctionBasedHelper` an alias this way allows callers to name it in
// terms meaningful to *them*, while preserving the type behavior described on
// the `abstract class FunctionBasedHelperInstance` below.

// This abstract class -- specifically, its `protected abstract __concrete__`
// member -- prevents subclasses from doing `class X extends helper(..)`, since
// that is an error at runtime. While it is rare that people would type that, it
// is not impossible and we use this to give them early signal via the types for
// a behavior which will break (and in a somewhat inscrutable way!) at runtime.
//
// This is needful because we lie about what this actually is for Glint's sake:
// a function-based helper returns a `Factory<SimpleHelper>`, which is designed
// to be "opaque" from a consumer's POV, i.e. not user-callable or constructible
// but only useable in a template (or via `invokeHelper()` which also treats it
// as a fully opaque `object` from a type POV). But Glint needs a `Helper<S>` to
// make it work the same way as class-based helpers. (Note that this does not
// hold for plain functions as helpers, which it can handle distinctly.) This
// signature thus makes it so that the item is usable *as* a `Helper` in Glint,
// but without letting end users treat it as a helper class instance.

/**
  In many cases it is not necessary to use the full `Helper` class.

  ```app/helpers/format-currency.js

  export default helper(function([cents], {currency}) {
    return `${currency}${cents * 0.01}`;

// the `helper` function and infer the resulting type correctly.

// This overload allows users to provide a `Signature` type explicitly at the

// this overload must appear second, since TS' inference engine will not
// correctly infer the type of `S` here from the types on the supplied callback.

function helper$1(helperFn) {
  // SAFETY: this is completely lies, in two ways:
  //
  // 1. `Wrapper` is a `Factory<SimpleHelper<S>>`, but from the perspective of

  //    the `Factory` relationship be hidden, because it is not public API for
  //    an end user to call `.create()` on a helper created this way. Instead,
  //    we provide them an `abstract new` signature (which means it cannot be
  //    directly constructed by calling `new` on it) and which does not have the
  //    `.create()` signature on it anymore.
  //
  // 2. The produced type here ends up being a subtype of `Helper`, which is not
  //    strictly true. This is necessary for the sake of Glint, which provides
  //    its information by way of a "declaration merge" with `Helper<S>` in the
  //    case of items produced by `helper()`.
  //

class Engine extends Namespace.extend(RegistryProxyMixin) {

  /**
    The goal of initializers should be to register dependencies and injections.
    This phase runs once. Because these initializers may load code, they are
    allowed to defer application readiness and advance it. If you need to access
    the container or store you should use an InstanceInitializer that will be run
    after all initializers and therefore after all code is loaded and the app is
    ready.
     Initializer receives an object which has the following attributes:
    `name`, `before`, `after`, `initialize`. The only required attribute is
    `initialize`, all others are optional.
     * `name` allows you to specify under which name the initializer is registered.
    This must be a unique name, as trying to register two initializers with the
    same name will result in an error.
     ```app/initializer/named-initializer.js
    import { debug } from '@ember/debug';
     export function initialize() {
      debug('Running namedInitializer!');
    }
     export default {
      name: 'named-initializer',
      initialize
    };
    ```
     * `before` and `after` are used to ensure that this initializer is ran prior
    or after the one identified by the value. This value can be a single string
    or an array of strings, referencing the `name` of other initializers.
     An example of ordering initializers, we create an initializer named `first`:
     ```app/initializer/first.js
    import { debug } from '@ember/debug';
     export function initialize() {
      debug('First initializer!');
    }
     export default {
      name: 'first',
      initialize
    };
    ```
     ```bash
    // DEBUG: First initializer!
    ```
     We add another initializer named `second`, specifying that it should run
    after the initializer named `first`:
     ```app/initializer/second.js
    import { debug } from '@ember/debug';
     export function initialize() {
      debug('Second initializer!');
    }
     export default {
      name: 'second',
      after: 'first',
      initialize
    };
    ```
     ```
    // DEBUG: First initializer!
    // DEBUG: Second initializer!
    ```
     Afterwards we add a further initializer named `pre`, this time specifying
    that it should run before the initializer named `first`:
     ```app/initializer/pre.js
    import { debug } from '@ember/debug';
     export function initialize() {
      debug('Pre initializer!');
    }
     export default {
      name: 'pre',
      before: 'first',
      initialize
    };
    ```
     ```bash
    // DEBUG: Pre initializer!
    // DEBUG: First initializer!
    // DEBUG: Second initializer!
    ```
     Finally we add an initializer named `post`, specifying it should run after
    both the `first` and the `second` initializers:
     ```app/initializer/post.js
    import { debug } from '@ember/debug';
     export function initialize() {
      debug('Post initializer!');
    }
     export default {
      name: 'post',
      after: ['first', 'second'],
      initialize
    };
    ```
     ```bash
    // DEBUG: Pre initializer!
    // DEBUG: First initializer!
    // DEBUG: Second initializer!
    // DEBUG: Post initializer!
    ```
     * `initialize` is a callback function that receives one argument,
      `application`, on which you can operate.
     Example of using `application` to register an adapter:
     ```app/initializer/api-adapter.js
    import ApiAdapter from '../utils/api-adapter';
     export function initialize(application) {
      application.register('api-adapter:main', ApiAdapter);
    }
     export default {
      name: 'post',
      after: ['first', 'second'],
      initialize
    };
    ```
     @method initializer
    @param initializer {Object}

  static initializer = buildInitializerMethod('initializers', 'initializer');

  /**
    Instance initializers run after all initializers have run. Because
    instance initializers run after the app is fully set up. We have access
    to the store, container, and other items. However, these initializers run
    after code has loaded and are not allowed to defer readiness.
     Instance initializer receives an object which has the following attributes:
    `name`, `before`, `after`, `initialize`. The only required attribute is
    `initialize`, all others are optional.
     * `name` allows you to specify under which name the instanceInitializer is
    registered. This must be a unique name, as trying to register two
    instanceInitializer with the same name will result in an error.
     ```app/initializer/named-instance-initializer.js
    import { debug } from '@ember/debug';

      initialize
    };
    ```

    or after the one identified by the value. This value can be a single string
    or an array of strings, referencing the `name` of other initializers.
     * See Application.initializer for discussion on the usage of before
    and after.
     Example instanceInitializer to preload data into the store.
     ```app/initializer/preload-data.js
     export function initialize(application) {
        var userConfig, userConfigEncoded, store;
        // We have a HTML escaped JSON representation of the user's basic
        // configuration generated server side and stored in the DOM of the main
        // index.html file. This allows the app to have access to a set of data
        // without making any additional remote calls. Good for basic data that is
        // needed for immediate rendering of the page. Keep in mind, this data,
        // like all local models and data can be manipulated by the user, so it
        // should not be relied upon for security or authorization.
         // Grab the encoded data from the meta tag
        userConfigEncoded = document.querySelector('head meta[name=app-user-config]').attr('content');
         // Unescape the text, then parse the resulting JSON into a real object
        userConfig = JSON.parse(unescape(userConfigEncoded));
         // Lookup the store
        store = application.lookup('service:store');

/**
  An instance of `Application` is the starting point for every Ember
  application. It instantiates, initializes and coordinates the
  objects that make up your app.

  Each Ember app has one and only one `Application` object. Although
  Ember CLI creates this object implicitly, the `Application` class
  is defined in the `app/app.js`. You can define a `ready` method on the
  `Application` class, which will be run by Ember when the application is
  initialized.

  ```app/app.js
  export default class App extends Application {
    ready() {
      // your code here
    }
  }
  ```

  Because `Application` ultimately inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes
  you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.
  See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.

  While you can think of your `Application` as a container that holds the
  other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities
  going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand. It is also important
  to understand that an `Application` is different from an `ApplicationInstance`.
  Refer to the Guides to understand the difference between these.

  ### Event Delegation

  Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework
  to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to
  do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own
  `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`
  listener on the `body`.

  If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and
  start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking
  their `mouseDown` method as it goes.

  `Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as
  well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For
  example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be
  called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.

  If there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by
  default, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method
  names by setting the application's `customEvents` property:

  ```app/app.js
  import Application from '@ember/application';

  export default class App extends Application {
    customEvents = {
      // add support for the paste event
      paste: 'paste'
    }
  }
  ```

  To prevent Ember from setting up a listener for a default event,
  specify the event name with a `null` value in the `customEvents`
  property:

  ```app/app.js
  import Application from '@ember/application';

  export default class App extends Application {
    customEvents = {
      // prevent listeners for mouseenter/mouseleave events
      mouseenter: null,
      mouseleave: null
    }
  }
  ```

  By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document
  body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside
  an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element
  inside the body.

  For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`
  should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:

  ```app/app.js
  import Application from '@ember/application';

  export default class App extends Application {
    rootElement = '#ember-app'
  }
  ```

  The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a CSS selector
  string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will
  not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only
  append views inside it!

  To learn more about the events Ember components use, see

  [components/handling-events](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/handling-events/#toc_event-names).

  ### Initializers

  To add behavior to the Application's boot process, you can define initializers in
  the `app/initializers` directory, or with `ember generate initializer` using Ember CLI.
  These files should export a named `initialize` function which will receive the created `application`
  object as its first argument.

  ```javascript
  export function initialize(application) {
    // application.inject('route', 'foo', 'service:foo');
  }
  ```

  Application initializers can be used for a variety of reasons including:

  - setting up external libraries
  - injecting dependencies
  - setting up event listeners in embedded apps
  - deferring the boot process using the `deferReadiness` and `advanceReadiness` APIs.

  ### Routing

  In addition to creating your application's router, `Application` is
  also responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions
  between routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more
  detailed intra-transition logging can be logged with
  the `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:

  ```javascript
  import Application from '@ember/application';

  let App = Application.create({
    LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions
    LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps
  });
  ```

  By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into
  application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you
  need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`
  method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.

  If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a
  `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing
  begins.

    Reset the application. This is typically used only in tests. It cleans up
    the application in the following order:
     1. Deactivate existing routes
    2. Destroy all objects in the container
    3. Create a new application container
    4. Re-route to the existing url
     Typical Example:
     ```javascript
    import Application from '@ember/application';
    let App;
     run(function() {
      App = Application.create();
    });
     module('acceptance test', {
      setup: function() {
        App.reset();
      }
    });
     test('first test', function() {
      // App is freshly reset
    });
     test('second test', function() {
      // App is again freshly reset
    });
    ```
     Advanced Example:
     Occasionally you may want to prevent the app from initializing during
    setup. This could enable extra configuration, or enable asserting prior
    to the app becoming ready.
     ```javascript
    import Application from '@ember/application';
    let App;
     run(function() {
      App = Application.create();
    });
     module('acceptance test', {
      setup: function() {
        run(function() {
          App.reset();
          App.deferReadiness();
        });
      }
    });
     test('first test', function() {
      ok(true, 'something before app is initialized');
       run(function() {
        App.advanceReadiness();
      });
       ok(true, 'something after app is initialized');
    });

    Boot a new instance of `ApplicationInstance` for the current
    application and navigate it to the given `url`. Returns a `Promise` that
    resolves with the instance when the initial routing and rendering is
    complete, or rejects with any error that occurred during the boot process.
     When `autoboot` is disabled, calling `visit` would first cause the
    application to boot, which runs the application initializers.
     This method also takes a hash of boot-time configuration options for
    customizing the instance's behavior. See the documentation on
    `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.
     `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` is an interface class that exists
    purely to document the available options; you do not need to construct it
    manually. Simply pass a regular JavaScript object containing of the
    desired options:
     ```javascript
    MyApp.visit("/", { location: "none", rootElement: "#container" });
    ```
     ### Supported Scenarios
     While the `BootOptions` class exposes a large number of knobs, not all
    combinations of them are valid; certain incompatible combinations might
    result in unexpected behavior.
     For example, booting the instance in the full browser environment
    while specifying a foreign `document` object (e.g. `{ isBrowser: true,
    document: iframe.contentDocument }`) does not work correctly today,
    largely due to Ember's jQuery dependency.
     Currently, there are three officially supported scenarios/configurations.
    Usages outside of these scenarios are not guaranteed to work, but please
    feel free to file bug reports documenting your experience and any issues
    you encountered to help expand support.
     #### Browser Applications (Manual Boot)
     The setup is largely similar to how Ember works out-of-the-box. Normally,
    Ember will boot a default instance for your Application on "DOM ready".
    However, you can customize this behavior by disabling `autoboot`.
     For example, this allows you to render a miniture demo of your application
    into a specific area on your marketing website:
     ```javascript
    import MyApp from 'my-app';
     $(function() {
      let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });
       let options = {
        // Override the router's location adapter to prevent it from updating
        // the URL in the address bar
        location: 'none',
         // Override the default `rootElement` on the app to render into a
        // specific `div` on the page
        rootElement: '#demo'
      };
       // Start the app at the special demo URL
      App.visit('/demo', options);
    });
    ```
     Or perhaps you might want to boot two instances of your app on the same
    page for a split-screen multiplayer experience:
     ```javascript
    import MyApp from 'my-app';
     $(function() {
      let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });
       let sessionId = MyApp.generateSessionID();
       let player1 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+1&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#left', location: 'none' });
      let player2 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+2&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#right', location: 'none' });
       Promise.all([player1, player2]).then(() => {
        // Both apps have completed the initial render
        $('#loading').fadeOut();
      });
    });
    ```
     Do note that each app instance maintains their own registry/container, so
    they will run in complete isolation by default.
     #### Server-Side Rendering (also known as FastBoot)
     This setup allows you to run your Ember app in a server environment using
    Node.js and render its content into static HTML for SEO purposes.
     ```javascript
    const HTMLSerializer = new SimpleDOM.HTMLSerializer(SimpleDOM.voidMap);
     function renderURL(url) {
      let dom = new SimpleDOM.Document();
      let rootElement = dom.body;
      let options = { isBrowser: false, document: dom, rootElement: rootElement };
       return MyApp.visit(options).then(instance => {
        try {
          return HTMLSerializer.serialize(rootElement.firstChild);
        } finally {
          instance.destroy();
        }
      });
    }
    ```
     In this scenario, because Ember does not have access to a global `document`
    object in the Node.js environment, you must provide one explicitly. In practice,
    in the non-browser environment, the stand-in `document` object only needs to
    implement a limited subset of the full DOM API. The `SimpleDOM` library is known
    to work.
     Since there is no DOM access in the non-browser environment, you must also
    specify a DOM `Element` object in the same `document` for the `rootElement` option
    (as opposed to a selector string like `"body"`).
     See the documentation on the `isBrowser`, `document` and `rootElement` properties
    on `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.
     #### Server-Side Resource Discovery
     This setup allows you to run the routing layer of your Ember app in a server
    environment using Node.js and completely disable rendering. This allows you
    to simulate and discover the resources (i.e. AJAX requests) needed to fulfill
    a given request and eagerly "push" these resources to the client.
     ```app/initializers/network-service.js
    import BrowserNetworkService from 'app/services/network/browser';
    import NodeNetworkService from 'app/services/network/node';
     // Inject a (hypothetical) service for abstracting all AJAX calls and use
    // the appropriate implementation on the client/server. This also allows the
    // server to log all the AJAX calls made during a particular request and use
    // that for resource-discovery purpose.
     export function initialize(application) {
      if (window) { // browser
        application.register('service:network', BrowserNetworkService);
      } else { // node
        application.register('service:network', NodeNetworkService);
      }
    };
     export default {
      name: 'network-service',
      initialize: initialize
    };
    ```
     ```app/routes/post.js
    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
    import { service } from '@ember/service';
     // An example of how the (hypothetical) service is used in routes.
     export default class IndexRoute extends Route {
      @service network;
       model(params) {
        return this.network.fetch(`/api/posts/${params.post_id}.json`);
      }
       afterModel(post) {
        if (post.isExternalContent) {
          return this.network.fetch(`/api/external/?url=${post.externalURL}`);
        } else {
          return post;
        }
      }
    }
    ```
     ```javascript
    // Finally, put all the pieces together
     function discoverResourcesFor(url) {
      return MyApp.visit(url, { isBrowser: false, shouldRender: false }).then(instance => {
        let networkService = instance.lookup('service:network');
        return networkService.requests; // => { "/api/posts/123.json": "..." }
      });
    }
    ```

/**
 * A WarpDriveSignal is a wrapper around a framework specific or TC39 signal
 * that enables us to store and manage the signal in a universal way.
 *
 * WarpDrive uses signals to manage three separate concepts:
 *
 * - as a `storage` for a value local to the object that we want to be reactive
 *   (see `@local` schema field for an example)
 * - as a `gate` for a memoized getter that we want to act as a reactive property
 *   but whose value is computed/pulled from a non-reactive source elsewhere
 *   and whose latest value is stored in the signal
 *   (see `field` schema field for an example)
 * - as a `gate` with a manually managed value updated on pull when `isStale` is true
 *
 *
 * It offers
 *
 * - a non-reactive way to access/update the current value
 * - a non-reactive way to mark the signal as dirtied
 * - a non-reactive way to store content for why the signal was dirtied
 * - access to the underlying Signal(s) in-use
 *
 * For debugging:
 * - the "key" or "name" of the signal
 * - the "object identity" or "context" to which the signal is attached

    This API allows you to provide a reference with new data. The

     If you pass a promise to `push`, Ember Data will not ask the adapter
    for the data if another attempt to fetch it is made in the
    interim. When the promise resolves, the underlying object is updated
    with the new data, and the promise returned by *this function* is resolved
    with that object.
     For example, `recordReference.push(promise)` will be resolved with a
    record.

      ```javascript
     let userRef = store.getReference('user', 1);
      // provide data for reference
     userRef.push({

/**
 * This is a clever optimization.
 *
 * clever optimizations rarely stand the test of time, so if you're
 * ever curious or think something better is possible please benchmark
 * and discuss. The benchmark for this at the time of writing is in
 * `scripts/benchmark-push.js`
 *
 * This approach turns out to be 150x faster in Chrome and node than
 * simply using push or concat. It's highly susceptible to the specifics
 * of the batch size, and may require tuning.
 *
 * Clever optimizations should always come with a `why`. This optimization
 * exists for two reasons.
 *
 * 1) array.push(...objects) and Array.prototype.push.apply(arr, objects)
 *   are susceptible to stack overflows. The size of objects at which this
 *   occurs varies by environment, browser, and current stack depth and memory
 *   pressure; however, it occurs in all browsers in fairly pristine conditions
 *   somewhere around 125k to 200k elements. Since WarpDrive regularly encounters
 *   arrays larger than this in size, we cannot use push.
 *
 * 2) `array.concat` or simply setting the array to a new reference is often an
 *   easier approach; however, native Proxy to an array cannot swap it's target array
 *   and attempts at juggling multiple array sources have proven to be victim to a number
 *   of browser implementation bugs. Should these bugs be addressed then we could
 *   simplify to using `concat`, however, do note this is currently 150x faster
 *   than concat, and due to the overloaded signature of concat will likely always
 *   be faster.

   * Only {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET | GET} requests with a url or requests with an explicit
   * {@link CacheOptions.key | cache key} will have the request result
   * and document cached.
   *
   * The cache key used is {@link RequestInfo.cacheOptions | RequestInfo.cacheOptions.key}
   * if present, falling back to {@link RequestInfo.url}.
   *
   * Params are not serialized as part of the cache-key, so
   * either ensure they are already in the url or utilize
   * `requestConfig.cacheOptions.key`. For queries issued
   * via the {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/POST | POST} method `requestConfig.cacheOptions.key`
   * MUST be supplied for the document to be cached.
   *
   * #### Requesting Without a Cache Key
   *
   * Resource data within the request is always updated in the cache,
   * regardless of whether a cache key is present for the request.
   *
   * #### Fulfilling From Cache
   *
   * When a cache-key is determined, the request may fulfill
   * from cache provided the cache is not stale.
   *
   * Cache staleness is determined by the configured {@link CachePolicy}
   * with priority given to the  {@link CacheOptions.reload} and
   * {@link CacheOptions.backgroundReload} on the request if present.
   *
   * If the cache data has soft expired or the request asks for a background
   * reload, the request will fulfill from cache if possible and
   * make a non-blocking request in the background to update the cache.
   *
   * If the cache data has hard expired or the request asks for a reload,
   * the request will not fulfill from cache and will make a blocking
   * request to update the cache.
   *
   * #### The Response
   *
   * The primary difference between {@link RequestManager.request} and `store.request`
   * is that `store.request` will convert the response into a {@link ReactiveDocument}
   * containing {@link Store.instantiateRecord | ReactiveResources}.

  /**
    This method returns a record for a given identifier or type and id combination.
     The `findRecord` method will always resolve its promise with the same
    object for a given identifier or type and `id`.
     The `findRecord` method will always return a **promise** that will be
    resolved with the record.
     **Example 1**
     ```js [app/routes/post.js]
    export default class PostRoute extends Route {
      model({ post_id }) {
        return this.store.findRecord('post', post_id);
      }
    }
    ```
     **Example 2**
     `findRecord` can be called with a single identifier argument instead of the combination
    of `type` (modelName) and `id` as separate arguments. You may recognize this combo as
    the typical pairing from [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-identification)
     ```js [app/routes/post.js]
    export default class PostRoute extends Route {
      model({ post_id: id }) {
        return this.store.findRecord({ type: 'post', id });
      }
    }
    ```
     **Example 3**
     If you have previously received an lid via an Identifier for this record, and the record
    has already been assigned an id, you can find the record again using just the lid.
     ```js [app/routes/post.js]
    store.findRecord({ lid });
    ```
     If the record is not yet available, the store will ask the adapter's `findRecord`
    method to retrieve and supply the necessary data. If the record is already present
    in the store, it depends on the reload behavior _when_ the returned promise
    resolves.
     ### Preloading
     You can optionally `preload` specific attributes and relationships that you know of
    by passing them via the passed `options`.
     For example, if your Ember route looks like `/posts/1/comments/2` and your API route
    for the comment also looks like `/posts/1/comments/2` if you want to fetch the comment
    without also fetching the post you can pass in the post to the `findRecord` call:
     ```js [app/routes/post-comments.js]
    export default class PostRoute extends Route {
      model({ post_id, comment_id: id }) {
        return this.store.findRecord({ type: 'comment', id, { preload: { post: post_id }} });
      }
    }
    ```
     In your adapter you can then access this id without triggering a network request via the
    snapshot:
     ```js [app/adapters/application.js]
    export default class Adapter {
       findRecord(store, schema, id, snapshot) {
        let type = schema.modelName;
         if (type === 'comment')
          let postId = snapshot.belongsTo('post', { id: true });
           return fetch(`./posts/${postId}/comments/${id}`)
            .then(response => response.json())
        }
      }
       static create() {
        return new this();
      }
    }
    ```
     This could also be achieved by supplying the post id to the adapter via the adapterOptions
    property on the options hash.
     ```js [app/routes/post-comments.js]
    export default class PostRoute extends Route {
      model({ post_id, comment_id: id }) {
        return this.store.findRecord({ type: 'comment', id, { adapterOptions: { post: post_id }} });
      }
    }
    ```
     ```js [app/adapters/application.js]
    export default class Adapter {
      findRecord(store, schema, id, snapshot) {
        let type = schema.modelName;
         if (type === 'comment')
          let postId = snapshot.adapterOptions.post;
           return fetch(`./posts/${postId}/comments/${id}`)
            .then(response => response.json())
        }
      }
       static create() {
        return new this();
      }
    }
    ```
     If you have access to the post model you can also pass the model itself to preload:
     ```javascript
    let post = await store.findRecord('post', '1');
    let comment = await store.findRecord('comment', '2', { post: myPostModel });
    ```
     ### Reloading
     The reload behavior is configured either via the passed `options` hash or
    the result of the adapter's `shouldReloadRecord`.
     If `{ reload: true }` is passed or `adapter.shouldReloadRecord` evaluates
    to `true`, then the returned promise resolves once the adapter returns
    data, regardless if the requested record is already in the store:
     ```js
    store.push({
      data: {
        id: 1,
        type: 'post',
        revision: 1
      }
    });
     // adapter#findRecord resolves with
    // [
    //   {
    //     id: 1,
    //     type: 'post',
    //     revision: 2
    //   }
    // ]
    store.findRecord('post', '1', { reload: true }).then(function(post) {
      post.revision; // 2
    });
    ```
     If no reload is indicated via the above mentioned ways, then the promise
    immediately resolves with the cached version in the store.
     ### Background Reloading
     Optionally, if `adapter.shouldBackgroundReloadRecord` evaluates to `true`,
    then a background reload is started, which updates the records' data, once
    it is available:
     ```js
    // app/adapters/post.js
    import ApplicationAdapter from "./application";
     export default class PostAdapter extends ApplicationAdapter {
      shouldReloadRecord(store, snapshot) {
        return false;
      },
       shouldBackgroundReloadRecord(store, snapshot) {
        return true;
      }
    });
     // ...
     store.push({
      data: {
        id: 1,
        type: 'post',
        revision: 1
      }
    });
     let blogPost = store.findRecord('post', '1').then(function(post) {
      post.revision; // 1
    });
     // later, once adapter#findRecord resolved with
    // [
    //   {
    //     id: 1,
    //     type: 'post',
    //     revision: 2
    //   }
    // ]
     blogPost.revision; // 2
    ```
     If you would like to force or prevent background reloading, you can set a
    boolean value for `backgroundReload` in the options object for
    `findRecord`.
     ```js [app/routes/post/edit.js]
    export default class PostEditRoute extends Route {
      model(params) {
        return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id, { backgroundReload: false });
      }
    }
    ```
     If you pass an object on the `adapterOptions` property of the options
    argument it will be passed to your adapter via the snapshot
     ```js [app/routes/post/edit.js]
    export default class PostEditRoute extends Route {
      model(params) {
        return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id, {
          adapterOptions: { subscribe: false }
        });
      }
    }
    ```
     ```js [app/adapters/post.js]
    import MyCustomAdapter from './custom-adapter';
     export default class PostAdapter extends MyCustomAdapter {
      findRecord(store, type, id, snapshot) {
        if (snapshot.adapterOptions.subscribe) {
          // ...
        }
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```
     See [peekRecord](../methods/peekRecord?anchor=peekRecord) to get the cached version of a record.
     ### Retrieving Related Model Records
     If you use an adapter such as Ember's default
    [`JSONAPIAdapter`](/ember-data/release/classes/JSONAPIAdapter)
    that supports the [JSON API specification](http://jsonapi.org/) and if your server
    endpoint supports the use of an
    ['include' query parameter](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes),
    you can use `findRecord()` or `findAll()` to automatically retrieve additional records related to
    the one you request by supplying an `include` parameter in the `options` object.
     For example, given a `post` model that has a `hasMany` relationship with a `comment`
    model, when we retrieve a specific post we can have the server also return that post's
    comments in the same request:
     ```js [app/routes/post.js]
    export default class PostRoute extends Route {
      model(params) {
        return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id, { include: ['comments'] });
      }
    }
    ```
     ```js [app/adapters/application.js]
    export default class Adapter {
      findRecord(store, schema, id, snapshot) {
        let type = schema.modelName;
         if (type === 'post')
          let includes = snapshot.adapterOptions.include;
           return fetch(`./posts/${postId}?include=${includes}`)
            .then(response => response.json())
        }
      }
       static create() {
        return new this();
      }
    }
    ```
     In this case, the post's comments would then be available in your template as
    `model.comments`.
     Multiple relationships can be requested using an `include` parameter consisting of a
    list of relationship names, while nested relationships can be specified
    using a dot-separated sequence of relationship names. So to request both the post's
    comments and the authors of those comments the request would look like this:
     ```js [app/routes/post.js]
    export default class PostRoute extends Route {
      model(params) {
        return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id, { include: ['comments','comments.author'] });
      }
    }
    ```
     ### Retrieving Specific Fields by Type
     If your server endpoint supports the use of a ['fields' query parameter](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-sparse-fieldsets),
    you can use pass those fields through to your server.  At this point in time, this requires a few manual steps on your part.
     1. Implement `buildQuery` in your adapter.
     ```js [app/adapters/application.js]
    buildQuery(snapshot) {
      let query = super.buildQuery(...arguments);
       let { fields } = snapshot.adapterOptions;
       if (fields) {
        query.fields = fields;
      }
       return query;
    }
    ```
     2. Then pass through the applicable fields to your `findRecord` request.
     Given a `post` model with attributes body, title, publishDate and meta, you can retrieve a filtered list of attributes.
     ```js [app/routes/post.js]
    export default class extends Route {
      model(params) {
        return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id, { adapterOptions: { fields: { post: 'body,title' } });
      }
    }
    ```
     Moreover, you can filter attributes on related models as well. If a `post` has a `belongsTo` relationship to a user,
    just include the relationship key and attributes.
     ```js [app/routes/post.js]
    export default class extends Route {
      model(params) {
        return this.store.findRecord('post', params.post_id, { adapterOptions: { fields: { post: 'body,title', user: 'name,email' } });
      }
    }
    ```

  /**
    This method makes a request for one record, where the `id` is not known
    beforehand (if the `id` is known, use [`findRecord`](../methods/findRecord?anchor=findRecord)
    instead).
     This method can be used when it is certain that the server will return a
    single object for the primary data.
     Each time this method is called a new request is made through the adapter.
     Let's assume our API provides an endpoint for the currently logged in user
    via:
     ```
    // GET /api/current_user
    {
      user: {
        id: 1234,
        username: 'admin'
      }
    }
    ```
     Since the specific `id` of the `user` is not known beforehand, we can use
    `queryRecord` to get the user:
     ```javascript
    store.queryRecord('user', {}).then(function(user) {
      let username = user.username;
      // do thing
    });
    ```
     The request is made through the adapters' `queryRecord`:
     ```js [app/adapters/user.js]
    import Adapter from '@ember-data/adapter';
    import $ from 'jquery';
     export default class UserAdapter extends Adapter {
      queryRecord(modelName, query) {
        return $.getJSON('/api/current_user');
      }
    }
    ```
     Note: the primary use case for `store.queryRecord` is when a single record
    is queried and the `id` is not known beforehand. In all other cases
    `store.query` and using the first item of the array is likely the preferred
    way:
     ```
    // GET /users?username=unique
    {
      data: [{
        id: 1234,
        type: 'user',
        attributes: {
          username: "unique"
        }
      }]
    }
    ```
     ```javascript
    store.query('user', { username: 'unique' }).then(function(users) {
      return users.firstObject;
    }).then(function(user) {
      let id = user.id;
    });
    ```
     This method returns a promise, which resolves with the found record.
     If the adapter returns no data for the primary data of the payload, then
    `queryRecord` resolves with `null`:
     ```
    // GET /users?username=unique
    {
      data: null
    }
    ```
     ```javascript
    store.queryRecord('user', { username: 'unique' }).then(function(user) {
       // user is null
    });
    ```

  /**
    `findAll` asks the adapter's `findAll` method to find the records for the
    given type, and returns a promise which will resolve with all records of
    this type present in the store, even if the adapter only returns a subset
    of them.
     ```js [app/routes/authors.js]
    export default class AuthorsRoute extends Route {
      model(params) {
        return this.store.findAll('author');
      }
    }
    ```
     _When_ the returned promise resolves depends on the reload behavior,
    configured via the passed `options` hash and the result of the adapter's
    `shouldReloadAll` method.
     ### Reloading
     If `{ reload: true }` is passed or `adapter.shouldReloadAll` evaluates to
    `true`, then the returned promise resolves once the adapter returns data,
    regardless if there are already records in the store:
     ```js
    store.push({
      data: {
        id: 'first',
        type: 'author'
      }
    });
     // adapter#findAll resolves with
    // [
    //   {
    //     id: 'second',
    //     type: 'author'
    //   }
    // ]
    store.findAll('author', { reload: true }).then(function(authors) {
      authors.getEach('id'); // ['first', 'second']
    });
    ```
     If no reload is indicated via the above mentioned ways, then the promise
    immediately resolves with all the records currently loaded in the store.
     ### Background Reloading
     Optionally, if `adapter.shouldBackgroundReloadAll` evaluates to `true`,
    then a background reload is started. Once this resolves, the array with
    which the promise resolves, is updated automatically so it contains all the
    records in the store:
     ```js [app/adapters/application.js]
    import Adapter from '@ember-data/adapter';
     export default class ApplicationAdapter extends Adapter {
      shouldReloadAll(store, snapshotsArray) {
        return false;
      },
       shouldBackgroundReloadAll(store, snapshotsArray) {
        return true;
      }
    });
     // ...
     store.push({
      data: {
        id: 'first',
        type: 'author'
      }
    });
     let allAuthors;
    store.findAll('author').then(function(authors) {
      authors.getEach('id'); // ['first']
       allAuthors = authors;
    });
     // later, once adapter#findAll resolved with
    // [
    //   {
    //     id: 'second',
    //     type: 'author'
    //   }
    // ]
     allAuthors.getEach('id'); // ['first', 'second']
    ```
     If you would like to force or prevent background reloading, you can set a
    boolean value for `backgroundReload` in the options object for
    `findAll`.
     ```js [app/routes/post/edit.js]
    export default class PostEditRoute extends Route {
      model() {
        return this.store.findAll('post', { backgroundReload: false });
      }
    }
    ```
     If you pass an object on the `adapterOptions` property of the options
    argument it will be passed to you adapter via the `snapshotRecordArray`
     ```js [app/routes/posts.js]
    export default class PostsRoute extends Route {
      model(params) {
        return this.store.findAll('post', {
          adapterOptions: { subscribe: false }
        });
      }
    }
    ```
     ```js [app/adapters/post.js]
    import MyCustomAdapter from './custom-adapter';
     export default class UserAdapter extends MyCustomAdapter {
      findAll(store, type, sinceToken, snapshotRecordArray) {
        if (snapshotRecordArray.adapterOptions.subscribe) {
          // ...
        }
        // ...
      }
    }
    ```
     See [peekAll](../methods/peekAll?anchor=peekAll) to get an array of current records in the
    store, without waiting until a reload is finished.
     ### Retrieving Related Model Records
     If you use an adapter such as Ember's default
    [`JSONAPIAdapter`](/ember-data/release/classes/JSONAPIAdapter)
    that supports the [JSON API specification](http://jsonapi.org/) and if your server
    endpoint supports the use of an
    ['include' query parameter](http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes),
    you can use `findAll()` to automatically retrieve additional records related to
    those requested by supplying an `include` parameter in the `options` object.
     For example, given a `post` model that has a `hasMany` relationship with a `comment`
    model, when we retrieve all of the post records we can have the server also return
    all of the posts' comments in the same request:
     ```js [app/routes/posts.js]
    export default class PostsRoute extends Route {
      model() {
        return this.store.findAll('post', { include: ['comments'] });
      }
    }
    ```
    Multiple relationships can be requested using an `include` parameter consisting of a
    list or relationship names, while nested relationships can be specified
    using a dot-separated sequence of relationship names. So to request both the posts'
    comments and the authors of those comments the request would look like this:
     ```js [app/routes/posts.js]
    export default class PostsRoute extends Route {
      model() {
        return this.store.findAll('post', { include: ['comments','comments.author'] });
      }
    }
    ```
     See [query](../methods/query?anchor=query) to only get a subset of records from the server.

     [Demo.](http://ember-twiddle.com/69cdbeaa3702159dc355)
     There are some typical properties for `JSONAPI` payload:
    * `id` - mandatory, unique record's key
    * `type` - mandatory string which matches `model`'s dasherized name in singular form
    * `attributes` - object which holds data for record attributes - `attr`'s declared in model
    * `relationships` - object which must contain any of the following properties under each relationships' respective key (example path is `relationships.achievements.data`):
      - [`links`](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-links)
      - [`data`](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-linkage) - place for primary data
      - [`meta`](http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-meta) - object which contains meta-information about relationship
     For this model:
     ```js [app/models/person.js]
    import Model, { attr, hasMany } from '@ember-data/model';
     export default class PersonRoute extends Route {
      @attr('string') firstName;
      @attr('string') lastName;
       @hasMany('person') children;
    }
    ```
     To represent the children as IDs:
     ```js
    {
      data: {
        id: '1',
        type: 'person',
        attributes: {
          firstName: 'Tom',
          lastName: 'Dale'
        },
        relationships: {
          children: {
            data: [
              {
                id: '2',
                type: 'person'
              },
              {
                id: '3',
                type: 'person'
              },
              {
                id: '4',
                type: 'person'
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
     [Demo.](http://ember-twiddle.com/343e1735e034091f5bde)
     To represent the children relationship as a URL:
     ```js
    {
      data: {
        id: '1',
        type: 'person',
        attributes: {
          firstName: 'Tom',
          lastName: 'Dale'
        },
        relationships: {
          children: {
            links: {
              related: '/people/1/children'
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
     If you're streaming data or implementing an adapter, make sure
    that you have converted the incoming data into this form. The
    store's [normalize](../methods/normalize?anchor=normalize) method is a convenience
    helper for converting a json payload into the form Ember Data
    expects.
     ```js
    store.push(store.normalize('person', data));
    ```
     This method can be used both to push in brand new
    records, as well as to update existing records.
     @public
    @param {Object} data
    @return the record(s) that was created or
      updated.

/**
  A `ManyArray` is a `MutableArray` that represents the contents of a has-many
  relationship.

  The `ManyArray` is instantiated lazily the first time the relationship is
  requested.

  This class is not intended to be directly instantiated by consuming applications.

  ### Inverses

  Often, the relationships in Ember Data applications will have
  an inverse. For example, imagine the following models are
  defined:

  ```js [app/models/post.js]
  import Model, { hasMany } from '@ember-data/model';

  export default class PostModel extends Model {
    @hasMany('comment') comments;
  }
  ```

  ```js [app/models/comment.js]
  import { Model, belongsTo } from '@warp-drive/legacy/model';

  export default class CommentModel extends Model {
    @belongsTo('post') post;
  }
  ```

  If you created a new instance of `Post` and added
  a `Comment` record to its `comments` has-many
  relationship, you would expect the comment's `post`
  property to be set to the post that contained
  the has-many.

  We call the record to which a relationship belongs-to the
  relationship's _owner_.

  /**
    The loading state of this array
     @property isLoaded
    @type {Boolean}

  /**
    Metadata associated with the request for async hasMany relationships.
     Example
     Given that the server returns the following JSON payload when fetching a
    hasMany relationship:
     ```js
    {
      "comments": [{
        "id": 1,
        "comment": "This is the first comment",
      }, {

       "meta": {
        "page": 1,
        "total": 5
      }
    }
    ```
     You can then access the meta data via the `meta` property:
     ```js
    let comments = await post.comments;
    let meta = comments.meta;
     // meta.page => 1
    // meta.total => 5

/**
 * RequestState extends the concept of PromiseState to provide a reactive

 * around a Future's control flow.
 *
 * It is useful in both Template and JavaScript contexts, allowing you
 * to quickly derive behaviors and data from pending, error and success
 * states.
 *
 * The key difference between a Promise and a Future is that Futures provide
 * access to a stream of their content, the identity of the request (if any)
 * as well as the ability to attempt to abort the request.
 *
 * ```ts
 * interface Future<T> extends Promise<T>> {
 *   getStream(): Promise<ReadableStream>;
 *   abort(): void;
 *   lid: StableDocumentIdentifier | null;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * These additional APIs allow us to craft even richer state experiences.
 *
 * To get the state of a request, use `getRequestState`.
 *
 * See also:
 * - {@link PendingRequest}
 * - {@link ResolvedRequest}
 * - {@link RejectedRequest}
 * - {@link CancelledRequest}

 *
 * ```gjs
 * import { getRequestState } from '@warp-drive/ember';
 *
 * <template>
 *   {{#let (getRequestState @request) as |state|}}
 *     {{#if state.isPending}}

        this occurs when we are likely polymorphic but not configured to be polymorphic
        most often due to extending a class that has a relationship definition on it.
         e.g.
         ```ts
        class Pet extends Model {
          @belongsTo('human', { async: false, inverse: 'pet' }) owner;
        }
        class Human extends Model {
          @belongsTo('pet', { async: false, inverse: 'owner' }) pet;
        }
        class Farmer extends Human {}
        ```
         In the above case, the following would trigger this error:
         ```ts
        let pet = store.createRecord('pet');
        let farmer = store.createRecord('farmer');
        farmer.pet = pet; // error
        ```
         The correct way to fix this is to specify the polymorphic option on Pet
        and to specify the abstract type 'human' on the Human base class.
         ```ts
        class Pet extends Model {
          @belongsTo('human', { async: false, inverse: 'pet', polymorphic: true }) owner;
        }
        class Human extends Model {
          @belongsTo('pet', { async: false, inverse: 'owner', as: 'human' }) pet;
        }
        class Farmer extends Human {}
        ```
         Alternatively both Human and Farmer could declare the relationship, because relationship
        definitions are "structural".
         ```ts
        class Pet extends Model {
          @belongsTo('human', { async: false, inverse: 'pet', polymorphic: true }) owner;
        }
        class Human extends Model {
          @belongsTo('pet', { async: false, inverse: 'owner', as: 'human' }) pet;
        }
        class Farmer extends Model {
          @belongsTo('pet', { async: false, inverse: 'owner', as: 'human' }) pet;
        }
        ```

Provides a performance tuned normalized graph for intelligently managing relationships between resources based on identity

While this Graph is abstract, it currently is a private implementation required as a peer-dependency by the {JSON:API} Cache Implementation.

We intend to make this Graph public API after some additional iteration during the 5.x timeframe, until then all APIs should be considered experimental and unstable, not fit for direct application or 3rd party library usage.

/**
 * A CacheHandler that adds support for using an WarpDrive Cache with a RequestManager.
 *
 * This handler will only run when a request has supplied a `store` instance. Requests
 * issued by the store via `store.request()` will automatically have the `store` instance
 * attached to the request.
 *
 * ```ts
 * requestManager.request({
 *   store: store,
 *   url: '/api/posts',
 *   method: 'GET'
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * When this handler elects to handle a request, it will return the raw `StructuredDocument`
 * unless the request has `[EnableHydration]` set to `true`. In this case, the handler will
 * return a `Document` instance that will automatically update the UI when the cache is updated
 * in the future and will hydrate any identifiers in the StructuredDocument into Record instances.
 *
 * When issuing a request via the store, [EnableHydration] is automatically set to `true`. This
 * means that if desired you can issue requests that utilize the cache without needing to also
 * utilize Record instances if desired.
 *
 * Said differently, you could elect to issue all requests via a RequestManager, without ever using
 * the store directly, by setting [EnableHydration] to `true` and providing a store instance. Not
 * necessarily the most useful thing, but the decoupled nature of the RequestManager and incremental-feature
 * approach of WarpDrive allows for this flexibility.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { EnableHydration } from '@warp-drive/core/types/request';
 *
 * requestManager.request({
 *   store: store,
 *   url: '/api/posts',
 *   method: 'GET',
 *   [EnableHydration]: true
 * });

/**
 * Command-like searching
 * ======================
 *
 * Given multiple search terms delimited by spaces.e.g. `^jscript .python$ ruby !java`,
 * search in a given text.
 *
 * Search syntax:
 *
 * | Token       | Match type                 | Description                            |
 * | ----------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
 * | `jscript`   | fuzzy-match                | Items that fuzzy match `jscript`       |
 * | `=scheme`   | exact-match                | Items that are `scheme`                |
 * | `'python`   | include-match              | Items that include `python`            |
 * | `!ruby`     | inverse-exact-match        | Items that do not include `ruby`       |
 * | `^java`     | prefix-exact-match         | Items that start with `java`           |
 * | `!^earlang` | inverse-prefix-exact-match | Items that do not start with `earlang` |
 * | `.js$`      | suffix-exact-match         | Items that end with `.js`              |
 * | `!.go$`     | inverse-suffix-exact-match | Items that do not end with `.go`       |
 *
 * A single pipe character acts as an OR operator. For example, the following
 * query matches entries that start with `core` and end with either`go`, `rb`,
 * or`py`.
 *
 * ```
 * ^core go$ | rb$ | py$
 * ```

/**
 * ### JSONAPICache
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { JSONAPICache } from '@warp-drive/json-api';
 * ```
 *
  A {@link Cache} implementation tuned for [{json:api}](https://jsonapi.org/)

  This format excels at simiplifying common complex problems around cache
  consistency and information density. Because most API responses can be quickly
  transformed into {json:api} format without losing any information, WarpDrive
  recommends that most apps use this Cache implementation.

  If a cache built to understand another format would do better for your app then
  it just needs to follow the same interface.

  Do you really need a cache? Are sunsets beautiful? Caching is what powers features like
  immutability, mutation management, and allows ***Warp*Drive** to understand your relational
  data.

  Some caches are simple request/response maps. ***Warp*Drive**'s is not. The Cache deeply
  understands the structure of your data, ensuring your data remains consistent both within
  and across requests.

      - chain save requests serially vs allowing concurrent saves

        on a per-request basis
      - change their save requests to only send a "PATCH" instead of a "PUT"
        so that only latest changes are involved in each request, and then also

  proxy.then(function(json){

  the proxy has bindable attributes which
  track the promises life cycle

  ```javascript
  proxy.get('isPending')   //=> true
  proxy.get('isSettled')  //=> false
  proxy.get('isRejected')  //=> false
  proxy.get('isFulfilled') //=> false
  ```

  When the $.getJSON completes, and the promise is fulfilled
  with json, the life cycle attributes will update accordingly.
  Note that $.getJSON doesn't return an ECMA specified promise,
  it is useful to wrap this with an `RSVP.resolve` so that it behaves
  as a spec compliant promise.

  ```javascript
  proxy.get('isPending')   //=> false
  proxy.get('isSettled')   //=> true
  proxy.get('isRejected')  //=> false
  proxy.get('isFulfilled') //=> true

  As the proxy is an ObjectProxy, and the json now its content,
  all the json properties will be available directly from the proxy.

  ```javascript
  // Assuming the following json:
  {
    firstName: 'Stefan',
    lastName: 'Penner'
  }

  // both properties will accessible on the proxy
  proxy.get('firstName') //=> 'Stefan'

/**
  An ArrayProxy wraps any other object that implements `Array` and/or
  `MutableArray,` forwarding all requests. This makes it very useful for
  a number of binding use cases or other cases where being able to swap
  out the underlying array is useful.

  A simple example of usage:

  ```javascript
  import { A } from '@ember/array';
  import ArrayProxy from '@ember/array/proxy';

  let pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish'];
  let ap = ArrayProxy.create({ content: A(pets) });

  ap.get('firstObject');                        // 'dog'
  ap.set('content', ['amoeba', 'paramecium']);
  ap.get('firstObject');                        // 'amoeba'
  ```

  This class can also be useful as a layer to transform the contents of
  an array, as they are accessed. This can be done by overriding
  `objectAtContent`:

  ```javascript
  import { A } from '@ember/array';
  import ArrayProxy from '@ember/array/proxy';

  let pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish'];
  let ap = ArrayProxy.create({
      content: A(pets),
      objectAtContent: function(idx) {
          return this.get('content').objectAt(idx).toUpperCase();
      }
  });

  ap.get('firstObject'); // . 'DOG'
  ```

  When overriding this class, it is important to place the call to
  `_super` *after* setting `content` so the internal observers have
  a chance to fire properly:

  ```javascript
  import { A } from '@ember/array';
  import ArrayProxy from '@ember/array/proxy';

  export default ArrayProxy.extend({
    init() {
      this.set('content', A(['dog', 'cat', 'fish']));
      this._super(...arguments);
    }
  });

  The callback method you provide should have the following signature:
  - `item` is the current item in the iteration.
  - `index` is the integer index of the current item in the iteration.

  ```javascript
  function mapCallback(item, index);
  ```

  Example:

  ```javascript
  import { set } from '@ember/object';
  import { map } from '@ember/object/computed';

  class Hamster {
    constructor(chores) {

  let hamster = new Hamster(['clean', 'write more unit tests']);

  hamster.excitingChores; // ['CLEAN!', 'WRITE MORE UNIT TESTS!']
  ```

  You can optionally pass an array of additional dependent keys as the second
  parameter to the macro, if your map function relies on any external values:

  ```javascript
  import { set } from '@ember/object';
  import { map } from '@ember/object/computed';

  class Hamster {
    shouldUpperCase = false;

    constructor(chores) {
      set(this, 'chores', chores);

/**
 A `HasManyReference` is a low-level API that allows access
 and manipulation of a hasMany relationship.

 It is especially useful when you're dealing with `async` relationships
 from `@ember-data/model` as it allows synchronous access to
 the relationship data if loaded, as well as APIs for loading, reloading
 the data or accessing available information without triggering a load.

 It may also be useful when using `sync` relationships with `@ember-data/model`
 that need to be loaded/reloaded with more precise timing than marking the
 relationship as `async` and relying on autofetch would have allowed.

 However,keep in mind that marking a relationship as `async: false` will introduce
 bugs into your application if the data is not always guaranteed to be available
 by the time the relationship is accessed. Ergo, it is recommended when using this
 approach to utilize `links` for unloaded relationship state instead of identifiers.

 Reference APIs are entangled with the relationship's underlying state,
 thus any getters or cached properties that utilize these will properly
 invalidate if the relationship state changes.

 References are "stable", meaning that multiple calls to retrieve the reference
  for a given relationship will always return the same HasManyReference.

   `push` can be used to update the data in the relationship and EmberData
   will treat the new data as the canonical value of this relationship on
   the backend. An empty array will signify the canonical value should be
   empty.
    Example model
    ```js [app/models/post.js]
   import { Model, hasMany } from '@warp-drive/legacy/model';
    export default class PostModel extends Model {
     @hasMany('comment', { async: true, inverse: null }) comments;
   }
   ```
    Setup some initial state, note we haven't loaded the comments yet:
    ```js
   const post = store.push({
     data: {
       type: 'post',
       id: '1',
       relationships: {
         comments: {
           data: [{ type: 'comment', id: '1' }]
         }
       }
     }
   });
    const commentsRef = post.hasMany('comments');
   commentsRef.ids(); // ['1']
   ```
    Update the state using `push`, note we can do this even without
   having loaded these comments yet by providing resource identifiers.
    Both full resources and resource identifiers are supported.
    ```js
   await commentsRef.push({
    data: [
     { type: 'comment', id: '2' },
     { type: 'comment', id: '3' },
    ]
   });
    commentsRef.ids(); // ['2', '3']
   ```
    For convenience, you can also pass in an array of resources or resource identifiers
   without wrapping them in the `data` property:
    ```js
   await commentsRef.push([
     { type: 'comment', id: '4' },
     { type: 'comment', id: '5' },
   ]);
    commentsRef.ids(); // ['4', '5']
   ```
    When using the `data` property, you may also include other resource data via included,
   as well as provide new links and meta to the relationship.
    ```js
   await commentsRef.push({
     links: {
       related: '/posts/1/comments'
     },
     meta: {
       total: 2
     },
     data: [
       { type: 'comment', id: '4' },
       { type: 'comment', id: '5' },
     ],
     included: [
       { type: 'other-thing', id: '1', attributes: { foo: 'bar' },
     ]
   });
   ```

   the returned promise with the ManyArray.
    Alternatively, pass `true` as the second argument to avoid fetching unloaded records
   and instead the promise will resolve with void without attempting to fetch. This is
   particularly useful if you want to update the state of the relationship without
   forcing the load of all of the associated records.

/**
 A `BelongsToReference` is a low-level API that allows access
 and manipulation of a belongsTo relationship.

 It is especially useful when you're dealing with `async` relationships
 from `@ember-data/model` as it allows synchronous access to
 the relationship data if loaded, as well as APIs for loading, reloading
 the data or accessing available information without triggering a load.

 It may also be useful when using `sync` relationships with `@ember-data/model`
 that need to be loaded/reloaded with more precise timing than marking the
 relationship as `async` and relying on autofetch would have allowed.

 However,keep in mind that marking a relationship as `async: false` will introduce
 bugs into your application if the data is not always guaranteed to be available
 by the time the relationship is accessed. Ergo, it is recommended when using this
 approach to utilize `links` for unloaded relationship state instead of identifiers.

 Reference APIs are entangled with the relationship's underlying state,
 thus any getters or cached properties that utilize these will properly
 invalidate if the relationship state changes.

 References are "stable", meaning that multiple calls to retrieve the reference
  for a given relationship will always return the same HasManyReference.

   `push` can be used to update the data in the relationship and EmberData
   will treat the new data as the canonical value of this relationship on
   the backend. A value of `null` (e.g. `{ data: null }`) can be passed to
   clear the relationship.
    Example model
    ```js [app/models/blog.js]
   import { Model, belongsTo } from '@warp-drive/legacy/model';
    export default class BlogModel extends Model {
      @belongsTo('user', { async: true, inverse: null }) user;
    }
   ```
    Setup some initial state, note we haven't loaded the user yet:
    ```js
   const blog = store.push({
      data: {
        type: 'blog',
        id: '1',
        relationships: {
          user: {
            data: { type: 'user', id: '1' }
          }
        }
      }
   });
    const userRef = blog.belongsTo('user');
   userRef.id(); // '1'
   ```
    Update the state using `push`, note we can do this even without
   having loaded the user yet by providing a resource-identifier.
    Both full a resource and a resource-identifier are supported.
    ```js
   await userRef.push({
      data: {
        type: 'user',
        id: '2',
      }
    });
     userRef.id(); // '2'
   ```
    You may also pass in links and meta fore the relationship, and sideload
   additional resources that might be required.
    ```js
    await userRef.push({
        data: {
          type: 'user',
          id: '2',
        },
        links: {
          related: '/articles/1/author'
        },
        meta: {
          lastUpdated: Date.now()
        },
        included: [
          {
            type: 'user-preview',
            id: '2',
            attributes: {
              username: '@runspired'
            }
          }
        ]
      });
    ```
    By default, the store will attempt to fetch the record if it is not loaded or its
   resource data is not included in the call to `push` before resolving the returned
   promise with the new state..
    Alternatively, pass `true` as the second argument to avoid fetching unloaded records
   and instead the promise will resolve with void without attempting to fetch. This is
   particularly useful if you want to update the state of the relationship without
   forcing the load of all of the associated record.
    @public
   @param {Object} doc a JSONAPI document object describing the new value of this relationship.
   @param {Boolean} [skipFetch] if `true`, do not attempt to fetch unloaded records
   @return {Promise<OpaqueRecordInstance | null | void>}
  */
  async push(doc, skipFetch) {
    const {
      store
    } = this;
    const isResourceData = doc.data && isMaybeResource(doc.data);
    const added = isResourceData ? store._push(doc, true) : doc.data ? store.identifierCache.getOrCreateRecordIdentifier(doc.data) : null;
    const {
      identifier
    } = this.belongsToRelationship;
    {
      if (added) {
        assertPolymorphicType(identifier, this.belongsToRelationship.definition, added, store);
      }
    }
    const newData = {};

    // only set data if it was passed in
    if (doc.data || doc.data === null) {
      newData.data = added;
    }
    if ('links' in doc) {
      newData.links = doc.links;
    }
    if ('meta' in doc) {
      newData.meta = doc.meta;
    }
    store._join(() => {

        record: identifier,
        field: this.key,
        value: newData
      });
    });
    if (!skipFetch) return this.load();
  }

  /**
   `value()` synchronously returns the current value of the belongs-to
   relationship. Unlike `record.relationshipName`, calling
   `value()` on a reference does not trigger a fetch if the async
   relationship is not yet loaded. If the relationship is not loaded
   it will always return `null`.
    Example
    ```javascript
   // models/blog.js
   import { Model, belongsTo } from '@warp-drive/legacy/model';
    export default class BlogModel extends Model {
     @belongsTo('user', { async: true, inverse: null }) user;

            data: { type: 'user', id: 1 }
          }
        }
      }
    });
   let userRef = blog.belongsTo('user');
    userRef.value(); // null
    // provide data for reference
   userRef.push({
      data: {
        type: 'user',
        id: 1,
        attributes: {
          username: "@user"
        }
      }
    }).then(function(user) {
      userRef.value(); // user
    });
   ```
     @public
   @return {Model} the record in this relationship
   */

    const resource = this._resource();
    return resource && resource.data ? this.store.peekRecord(resource.data) : null;
  }

  /**
   Loads a record in a belongs-to relationship if it is not already
   loaded. If the relationship is already loaded this method does not
   trigger a new load.
    Example
    ```javascript
   // models/blog.js
   import { Model, belongsTo } from '@warp-drive/legacy/model';
    export default class BlogModel extends Model {

            data: { type: 'user', id: 1 }
          }

   ```
    You may also pass in an options object whose properties will be
   fed forward. This enables you to pass `adapterOptions` into the
   request given to the adapter via the reference.

     userRef.value() === user;

     findRecord(store, type, id, snapshot) {
       // In the adapter you will have access to adapterOptions.
       let adapterOptions = snapshot.adapterOptions;
     }
   });
   ```
     @public
   @param {Object} options the options to pass in.
   @return {Promise} a promise that resolves with the record in this belongs-to relationship.

/**
  Holds validation errors for a given record, organized by attribute names.

  This class is not directly instantiable.

  Every `Model` has an `errors` property that is an instance of
  `Errors`. This can be used to display validation error
  messages returned from the server when a `record.save()` rejects.

  For Example, if you had a `User` model that looked like this:

  ```js [app/models/user.js]
  import { Model, attr } from '@warp-drive/legacy/model';

  export default class UserModel extends Model {
    @attr('string') username;
    @attr('string') email;
  }
  ```
  And you attempted to save a record that did not validate on the backend:

  ```javascript
  let user = store.createRecord('user', {
    username: 'tomster',
    email: 'invalidEmail'
  });
  user.save();
  ```

  Your backend would be expected to return an error response that described
  the problem, so that error messages can be generated on the app.

  API responses will be translated into instances of `Errors` differently,
  depending on the specific combination of adapter and serializer used. You
  may want to check the documentation or the source code of the libraries
  that you are using, to know how they expect errors to be communicated.

  Errors can be displayed to the user by accessing their property name
  to get an array of all the error objects for that property. Each
  error object is a JavaScript object with two keys:

  - `message` A string containing the error message from the backend
  - `attribute` The name of the property associated with this error message

  ```handlebars
  <label>Username: <Input @value={{@model.username}} /> </label>
  {{#each @model.errors.username as |error|}}
    <div class="error">
      {{error.message}}
    </div>
  {{/each}}

  <label>Email: <Input @value={{@model.email}} /> </label>
  {{#each @model.errors.email as |error|}}
    <div class="error">
      {{error.message}}
    </div>
  {{/each}}
  ```

  You can also access the special `messages` property on the error
  object to get an array of all the error strings.

  ```handlebars
  {{#each @model.errors.messages as |message|}}
    <div class="error">
      {{message}}
    </div>
  {{/each}}
  ```

 *
 * This package provides [*Ember***Data**](https://github.com/emberjs/data/)'s `Store` class.
 *
 * A [Store](https://api.emberjs.com/ember-data/release/classes/Store) coordinates interaction between your application, a [Cache](https://api.emberjs.com/ember-data/release/classes/%3CInterface%3E%20Cache),
 * and sources of data (such as your API or a local persistence layer) accessed via a [RequestManager](https://github.com/emberjs/data/tree/main/packages/request).
 *
 * Optionally, a Store can be configured to hydrate the response data into rich presentation classes.
 *
 * ## Installation
 *
 * If you have installed `ember-data` then you already have this package installed.
 * Otherwise you can install it using your javascript package manager of choice.
 * For instance with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
 *
 * ```
 * pnpm add @ember-data/store
 * ```
 *
 * After installing you will want to configure your first `Store`. Read more below
 * for how to create and configure stores for your application.
 *
 *
 * ## 🔨 Creating A Store
 *
 * To use a `Store` we will need to do few things: add a [Cache](https://api.emberjs.com/ember-data/release/classes/%3CInterface%3E%20Cache)
 * to store data **in-memory**, add a [Handler](https://api.emberjs.com/ember-data/release/classes/%3CInterface%3E%20Cache) to fetch data from a source,
 * and implement `instantiateRecord` to tell the store how to display the data for individual resources.
 *
 * > **Note**
 * > If you are using the package `ember-data` then a JSON:API cache, RequestManager, LegacyNetworkHandler,
 * > and `instantiateRecord` are configured for you by default.
 *
 * ### Configuring A Cache
 *
 * To start, let's install a [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) cache. If your app uses `GraphQL` or `REST` other
 * caches may better fit your data. You can author your own cache by creating one that
 * conforms to the [spec](https://api.emberjs.com/ember-data/release/classes/%3CInterface%3E%20Cache).
 *
 * The package `@ember-data/json-api` provides a [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/) cache we can use.
 * After installing it, we can configure the store to use this cache.
 *
 * ```js
 * import Store from '@ember-data/store';
 * import Cache from '@ember-data/json-api';
 *
 * class extends Store {
 *   createCache(storeWrapper) {
 *     return new Cache(storeWrapper);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Now that we have a `cache` let's setup something to handle fetching
 * and saving data via our API.
 *
 * > **Note**
 * > The `ember-data` package automatically includes and configures
 * > the `@ember-data/json-api` cache for you.
 *
 * ### Handling Requests
 *
 * When *Ember***Data** needs to fetch or save data it will pass that request to your application's `RequestManager` for fulfillment. How this fulfillment occurs (in-memory, device storage, via single or multiple API requests, etc.) is then up to the registered request handlers.
 *
 * To start, let's install the `RequestManager` from `@ember-data/request` and the basic `Fetch` handler from ``@ember-data/request/fetch`.
 *
 * > **Note**
 * > If your app uses `GraphQL`, `REST` or different conventions for `JSON:API` than your cache expects, other handlers may better fit your data. You can author your own handler by creating one that conforms to the [handler interface](https://github.com/emberjs/data/tree/main/packages/request#handling-requests).
 *
 * ```ts
 * import Store from '@ember-data/store';
 * import RequestManager from '@ember-data/request';
 * import Fetch from '@ember-data/request/fetch';
 *
 * export default class extends Store {
 *   requestManager = new RequestManager()
 *    .use([Fetch]);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **Using RequestManager as a Service**
 *
 * Alternatively if you have configured the `RequestManager` to be a service you may re-use it.
 *
 * *app/services/request.js*
 * ```ts
 * import RequestManager from '@ember-data/request';
 * import Fetch from '@ember-data/request/fetch';
 *
 * export default {
 *   create() {
 *     return new RequestManager()
 *       .use([Fetch])
 *       .useCache(CacheHandler);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * *app/services/store.js*
 * ```ts
 * import Store from '@ember-data/store';
 * import { service } from '@ember/service';
 *
 * export default class extends Store {
 *   @service('request') requestManager
 * }
 * ```
 *
 *
 * ### Presenting Data from the Cache
 *
 * Now that we have a source and a cache for our data, we need to configure how
 * the Store delivers that data back to our application. We do this via the hook
 * [instantiateRecord](https://api.emberjs.com/ember-data/release/classes/Store/methods/instantiateRecord%20(hook)?anchor=instantiateRecord%20(hook)),
 * which allows us to transform the data for a resource before handing it to the application.
 *
 * A naive way to present the data would be to return it as JSON. Typically instead
 * this hook will be used to add reactivity and make each unique resource a singleton,
 * ensuring that if the cache updates our presented data will reflect the new state.
 *
 * Below is an example of using the hooks `instantiateRecord` and a `teardownRecord`
 * to provide minimal read-only reactive state for simple resources.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import Store, { recordIdentifierFor } from '@ember-data/store';
 * import { TrackedObject } from 'tracked-built-ins';
 *
 * class extends Store {
 *   instantiateRecord(identifier) {
 *     const { cache, notifications } = this;
 *
 *     // create a TrackedObject with our attributes, id and type
 *     const record = new TrackedObject(Object.assign({}, cache.peek(identifier)));
 *     record.type = identifier.type;
 *     record.id = identifier.id;
 *
 *     notifications.subscribe(identifier, (_, change) => {
 *       if (change === 'attributes') {
 *         Object.assign(record, cache.peek(identifier));
 *       }
 *     });
 *
 *     return record;
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Because `instantiateRecord` is opaque to the nature of the record, an implementation
 * can be anything from a fairly simple object to a robust proxy that intelligently links
 * together associated records through relationships.
 *
 * This also enables creating a record that separates `edit` flows from `create` flows
 * entirely. A record class might choose to implement a `checkout`method that gives access
 * to an editable instance while the primary record continues to be read-only and reflect
 * only persisted (non-mutated) state.
 *
 * Typically you will choose an existing record implementation such as `@ember-data/model`
 * for your application.
 *
 * Because of the boundaries around instantiation and the cache, record implementations
 * should be capable of interop both with each other and with any `Cache`. Due to this,
 * if needed an application can utilize multiple record implementations and multiple cache
 * implementations either to support enhanced features for only a subset of records or to
 * be able to incrementally migrate from one record/cache to another record or cache.
 *
 * > **Note**
 * > The `ember-data` package automatically includes the `@ember-data/model`
 * > package and configures it for you.

/**
  The `DataAdapter` helps a data persistence library
  interface with tools that debug Ember such
  as the [Ember Inspector](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-inspector)
  for Chrome and Firefox.

  This class will be extended by a persistence library
  which will override some of the methods with
  library-specific code.

  The methods likely to be overridden are:

  * `getFilters`
  * `detect`
  * `columnsForType`
  * `getRecords`
  * `getRecordColumnValues`
  * `getRecordKeywords`
  * `getRecordFilterValues`
  * `getRecordColor`

  The adapter will need to be registered
  in the application's container as `dataAdapter:main`.

  Example:

  ```javascript
  Application.initializer({
    name: "data-adapter",

    initialize: function(application) {
      application.register('data-adapter:main', DS.DataAdapter);
    }
  });

/**
 * The `Component` class defines an encapsulated UI element that is rendered to
 * the DOM. A component is made up of a template and, optionally, this component
 * object.
 *
 * ## Defining a Component
 *
 * To define a component, subclass `Component` and add your own properties,
 * methods and lifecycle hooks:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import Component from '@glimmer/component';
 *
 * export default class extends Component {
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Lifecycle Hooks
 *
 * Lifecycle hooks allow you to respond to changes to a component, such as when
 * it gets created, rendered, updated or destroyed. To add a lifecycle hook to a
 * component, implement the hook as a method on your component subclass.
 *
 * For example, to be notified when Glimmer has rendered your component so you
 * can attach a legacy jQuery plugin, implement the `didInsertElement()` method:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import Component from '@glimmer/component';
 *
 * export default class extends Component {
 *   didInsertElement() {
 *     $(this.element).pickadate();
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Data for Templates
 *
 * `Component`s have two different kinds of data, or state, that can be
 * displayed in templates:
 *
 * 1. Arguments
 * 2. Properties
 *
 * Arguments are data that is passed in to a component from its parent
 * component. For example, if I have a `UserGreeting` component, I can pass it
 * a name and greeting to use:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * <UserGreeting @name="Ricardo" @greeting="Olá" />
 * ```
 *
 * Inside my `UserGreeting` template, I can access the `@name` and `@greeting`
 * arguments that I've been given:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * {{@greeting}}, {{@name}}!
 * ```
 *
 * Arguments are also available inside my component:
 *
 * ```ts
 * console.log(this.args.greeting); // prints "Olá"
 * ```
 *
 * Properties, on the other hand, are internal to the component and declared in
 * the class. You can use properties to store data that you want to show in the
 * template, or pass to another component as an argument.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import Component from '@glimmer/component';
 *
 * export default class extends Component {
 *   user = {
 *     name: 'Robbie'
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * In the above example, we've defined a component with a `user` property that
 * contains an object with its own `name` property.
 *
 * We can render that property in our template:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * Hello, {{user.name}}!
 * ```
 *
 * We can also take that property and pass it as an argument to the
 * `UserGreeting` component we defined above:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * <UserGreeting @greeting="Hello" @name={{user.name}} />
 * ```
 *
 * ## Arguments vs. Properties
 *
 * Remember, arguments are data that was given to your component by its parent
 * component, and properties are data your component has defined for itself.
 *
 * You can tell the difference between arguments and properties in templates
 * because arguments always start with an `@` sign (think "A is for arguments"):
 *
 * ```hbs
 * {{@firstName}}
 * ```
 *
 * We know that `@firstName` came from the parent component, not the current
 * component, because it starts with `@` and is therefore an argument.
 *
 * On the other hand, if we see:
 *
 * ```hbs
 * {{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * We know that `name` is a property on the component. If we want to know where
 * the data is coming from, we can go look at our component class to find out.
 *
 * Inside the component itself, arguments always show up inside the component's
 * `args` property. For example, if `{{@firstName}}` is `Tom` in the template,
 * inside the component `this.args.firstName` would also be `Tom`.

/**
  A component is a reusable UI element that consists of a `.hbs` template and an
  optional JavaScript class that defines its behavior. For example, someone
  might make a `button` in the template and handle the click behavior in the
  JavaScript file that shares the same name as the template.

  Components are broken down into two categories:

  - Components _without_ JavaScript, that are based only on a template. These
    are called Template-only or TO components.
  - Components _with_ JavaScript, which consist of a template and a backing
    class.

  Ember ships with two types of JavaScript classes for components:

  1. Glimmer components, imported from `@glimmer/component`, which are the
     default components for Ember Octane (3.15) and more recent editions.
  2. Classic components, imported from `@ember/component`, which were the
     default for older editions of Ember (pre 3.15).

  Below is the documentation for Template-only and Glimmer components. If you
  are looking for the API documentation for Classic components, it is
  [available here](/ember/release/classes/Component). The source code for
  Glimmer components can be found in [`@glimmer/component`](https://github.com/glimmerjs/glimmer.js/tree/master/packages/%40glimmer/component).

  ## Defining a Template-only Component

  The simplest way to create a component is to create a template file in
  `app/templates/components`. For example, if you name a template
  `app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs`:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{@person.name}}</h1>
  <img src={{@person.avatar}}>
  <p class='signature'>{{@person.signature}}</p>
  ```

  You will be able to use `<PersonProfile />` to invoke this component elsewhere
  in your application:

  ```app/templates/application.hbs
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} />
  ```

  Note that component names are capitalized here in order to distinguish them
  from regular HTML elements, but they are dasherized in the file system.

  While the angle bracket invocation form is generally preferred, it is also
  possible to invoke the same component with the `{{person-profile}}` syntax:

  ```app/templates/application.hbs
  {{person-profile person=this.currentUser}}
  ```

  Note that with this syntax, you use dashes in the component name and
  arguments are passed without the `@` sign.

  In both cases, Ember will render the content of the component template we
  created above. The end result will be something like this:

  ```html
  <h1>Tomster</h1>
  <img src="https://emberjs.com/tomster.jpg">
  <p class='signature'>Out of office this week</p>
  ```

  ## File System Nesting

  Components can be nested inside sub-folders for logical groupping. For
  example, if we placed our template in
  `app/templates/components/person/short-profile.hbs`, we can invoke it as
  `<Person::ShortProfile />`:

  ```app/templates/application.hbs
  <Person::ShortProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} />
  ```

  Or equivalently, `{{person/short-profile}}`:

  ```app/templates/application.hbs
  {{person/short-profile person=this.currentUser}}
  ```

  ## Using Blocks

  You can use `yield` inside a template to include the **contents** of any block
  attached to the component. For instance, if we added a `{{yield}}` to our
  component like so:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{@person.name}}</h1>
  {{yield}}
  ```

  We could then invoke it like this:

  ```handlebars
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>
    <p>Admin mode</p>
  </PersonProfile>
  ```

  or with curly syntax like this:

  ```handlebars
  {{#person-profile person=this.currentUser}}
    <p>Admin mode</p>
  {{/person-profile}}
  ```

  And the content passed in between the brackets of the component would be
  rendered in the same place as the `{{yield}}` within it, replacing it.

  Blocks are executed in their original context, meaning they have access to the
  scope and any in-scope variables where they were defined.

  ### Passing parameters to blocks

  You can also pass positional parameters to `{{yield}}`, which are then made
  available in the block:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{@person.name}}</h1>
  {{yield @person.signature}}
  ```

  We can then use this value in the block like so:

  ```handlebars
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} as |signature|>
    {{signature}}
  </PersonProfile>
  ```

  ### Passing multiple blocks

  You can pass multiple blocks to a component by giving them names, and
  specifying which block you are yielding to with `{{yield}}`. For instance, if
  we wanted to add a way for users to customize the title of our
  `<PersonProfile>` component, we could add a named block inside of the header:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{yield to="title"}}</h1>
  {{yield}}
  ```

  This component could then be invoked like so:

  ```handlebars
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>
    <:title>{{this.currentUser.name}}</:title>
    <:default>{{this.currentUser.signature}}</:default>
  </PersonProfile>
  ```

  When passing named blocks, you must name every block, including the `default`
  block, which is the block that is defined if you do not pass a `to` parameter
  to `{{yield}}`. Whenever you invoke a component without passing explicitly
  named blocks, the passed block is considered the `default` block.

  ### Passing parameters to named blocks

  You can also pass parameters to named blocks:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{yield @person.name to="title"}}</h1>
  {{yield @person.signature}}
  ```

  These parameters can then be used like so:

  ```handlebars
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>
    <:title as |name|>{{name}}</:title>
    <:default as |signature|>{{signature}}</:default>
  </PersonProfile>
  ```

  ### Checking to see if a block exists

  You can also check to see if a block exists using the `(has-block)` keyword,
  and conditionally use it, or provide a default template instead.

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>
    {{#if (has-block "title")}}
      {{yield @person.name to="title"}}
    {{else}}
      {{@person.name}}
    {{/if}}
  </h1>

  {{#if (has-block)}}
    {{yield @person.signature}}
  {{else}}
    {{@person.signature}}
  {{/if}}
  ```

  With this template, we can then optionally pass in one block, both blocks, or
  none at all:

  ```handlebars
  {{! passing both blocks }}
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>
    <:title as |name|>{{name}}</:title>
    <:default as |signature|>{{signature}}</:default>
  </PersonProfile>

  {{! passing just the title block }}
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}>
    <:title as |name|>{{name}}</:title>
  </PersonProfile>

  {{! passing just the default block }}
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}} as |signature|>
    {{signature}}
  </PersonProfile>

  {{! not passing any blocks }}
  <PersonProfile @person={{this.currentUser}}/>
  ```

  ### Checking to see if a block has parameters

  We can also check if a block receives parameters using the `(has-block-params)`
  keyword, and conditionally yield different values if so.

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  {{#if (has-block-params)}}
    {{yield @person.signature}}
  {{else}}
    {{yield}}
  {{/if}}
  ```

  ## Customizing Components With JavaScript

  To add JavaScript to a component, create a JavaScript file in the same
  location as the template file, with the same name, and export a subclass
  of `Component` as the default value. For example, to add Javascript to the
  `PersonProfile` component which we defined above, we would create
  `app/components/person-profile.js` and export our class as the default, like
  so:

  ```app/components/person-profile.js
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';

  export default class PersonProfileComponent extends Component {
    get displayName() {
      let { title, firstName, lastName } = this.args.person;

      if (title) {
        return `${title} ${lastName}`;
      } else {
        return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;
      }
    })
  }
  ```

  You can add your own properties, methods, and lifecycle hooks to this
  subclass to customize its behavior, and you can reference the instance of the
  class in your template using `{{this}}`. For instance, we could access the
  `displayName` property of our `PersonProfile` component instance in the
  template like this:

  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs
  <h1>{{this.displayName}}</h1>
  {{yield}}
  ```

  ## `constructor`

  params: `owner` object and `args` object

  Constructs a new component and assigns itself the passed properties. The
  constructor is run whenever a new instance of the component is created, and
  can be used to setup the initial state of the component.

  ```javascript
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';

  export default class SomeComponent extends Component {
    constructor(owner, args) {
      super(owner, args);

      if (this.args.displayMode === 'list') {
        this.items = [];
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  Service injections and arguments are available in the constructor.

  ```javascript
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';
  import { service } from '@ember/service';

  export default class SomeComponent extends Component {
    @service myAnimations;

    constructor(owner, args) {
      super(owner, args);

      if (this.args.fadeIn === true) {
        this.myAnimations.register(this, 'fade-in');
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  ## `willDestroy`

  `willDestroy` is called after the component has been removed from the DOM, but
  before the component is fully destroyed. This lifecycle hook can be used to
  cleanup the component and any related state.

  ```javascript
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';
  import { service } from '@ember/service';

  export default class SomeComponent extends Component {
    @service myAnimations;

    willDestroy() {
      super.willDestroy(...arguments);

      this.myAnimations.unregister(this);
    }
  }
  ```

  ## `args`

  The `args` property of Glimmer components is an object that contains the
  _arguments_ that are passed to the component. For instance, the
  following component usage:

  ```handlebars
  <SomeComponent @fadeIn={{true}} />
  ```

  Would result in the following `args` object to be passed to the component:

  ```javascript
  { fadeIn: true }
  ```

  `args` can be accessed at any point in the component lifecycle, including
  `constructor` and `willDestroy`. They are also automatically marked as tracked
  properties, and they can be depended on as computed property dependencies:

  ```javascript
  import Component from '@glimmer/component';
  import { computed } from '@ember/object';

  export default class SomeComponent extends Component {

    @computed('args.someValue')
    get computedGetter() {
      // updates whenever args.someValue updates
      return this.args.someValue;
    }

    get standardGetter() {
      // updates whenever args.anotherValue updates (Ember 3.13+)
      return this.args.anotherValue;
    }
  }
  ```

  ## `isDestroying`

  A boolean flag to tell if the component is in the process of destroying. This is set to
  true before `willDestroy` is called.

  ## `isDestroyed`
  A boolean to tell if the component has been fully destroyed. This is set to true
  after `willDestroy` is called.
